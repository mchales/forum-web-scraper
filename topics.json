I had a lumpectomy and radiation treatment (no chemo). I started Tamoxifen in 2021 and I experienced the side effects right away: very heavy and long periods, spotting, a lot of cramps almost weekly. I used to be regular but then I became very irregular. My iron levels went down dramatically and I think the reason was the very heavy periods. I had to be on iron supplements which made me feel horrible. I didn't think I was having a good quality of life so I asked my oncologist if it was OK to stop and she said \"definitely!!\". So I stopped for more than a year but of course the idea of the recurrence kept bugging me...so in my last check-up with the oncologist I told her I was really concerned about the recurrence and I asked her what we could do. She suggested reducing the dose, instead of 20 mg/day just do 5 mg/day by splitting the pill. I started at the end of December 2022 and I'm now feeling the same side effects: cramping, long periods, I had my last period 15 days ago (which was longer than usual) and now I'm bleeding again very heavily and it's very painful (I should say my periods were heavy before Tamoxifen, but at least I was regular, and now my periods are even heavier and longer). Because of the very frequent spotting and cramps I already had two endometrial biopsies which came out negative. At this pace I'll have to have another biopsy again soon. I really don't know what to do and my oncologist just tells me it's up to me. Does it ever get stable?

She told us my wife’s benefit would be less than 1%, and due to the adverse effects of tamoxifen, we decided to forgo hormone therapy. Fast forward one year, and I have been very nervous about this decision, so we had a second opinion, with an oncologist in the same hospital, the oncologist said that my wife’s risk of reoccurrence was between 5-10%, mostly because it was multifocal. She said tamoxifen would cut the risk of that down by about 40%. She gave us the same option.

I had chemo, just finished surgery and will likely start radiation in January, 2020. My MO wanted me to start Anastrozole now, I am not sure as I haven't fully understand the side effect of Anastrozole. Check with the MO is not an option as I am completely disappointed with her team. She sent me to see my PCP when I experienced bone pain after the first AC because they did not believe it was a side effect (it was). They sent me to see a GI doctor when my Hemoglobin was low (without telling me that it was an expected side effect), They told me to continue with the muscle relaxation medicine after I told them it did not work and I already tried for 24 hours (another 24 hours later, I found out I had an infection). I need some time to learn more about the side effect anastrozole (yes I will be reading this forum) before taking it. I am scared that I will be all alone to figure out how to address the side effects or what to do when they sent me to a wild goose chase. My question is whether anyone started anastrozole before radiation. TIA.", "Details": ""},

But never all at once, thankfully, and most of the time I've also been able to at least partially attribute the symptoms to inadequate sleep/exercise/diet.

Maybe more interestingly, it seems like my side effects are worse after I've missed a dose and then gotten back on track. It happens maybe once or twice a month. I don't worry too much about it because my understanding is that it stays in my system for several days so I'm still covered by the previous few doses.

I have profound fatigue and just feel flat, as if someone took away my ability to feel joy. With that being said I recently tried a break and went on 10 mg to see if it would help. I felt the same on the 10 so I am back on the 20 mg. I spoke to my MO about the breast cancer index test because I just wanted all available information I could have. She went ahead and ordered it even though it was a year early. She said maybe if it comes back low risk And no further benefit she would be more comfortable with me stopping sooner than the 5 years. I got my results and have some questions. I don’t see here until the end of next month to discuss so was hoping someone on here had some insight. My results are as follows likely to benefit from extended hormone therapy: Yes. Risk of late distant recurrence with5 yrs total endocrine therapy: 15.4%. With a total of 10 years: 8.9%-10.3%. It considers greater than 8.5% high risk from what I understand. It also has a percentage that states BCI test result if ordered at time of diagnosis. Mine says cumulative risk of distant recurrence 0-10 years is 42.1%. To finally get to my questions:) I wasn’t expecting the cumulative risk score and not sure of the significance. Does that exclude treatments such as surgery, rads, endocrine therapy? If my mammaprint was low risk how is that number so high? I assume if I do decide to quit early that 15.4% risk goes up correct? I feel like I have never had any doctor be able to tell me my potential risk percentage so I was a bit startled by this result. If anyone has any insight or can clarify further I would appreciate it.

Took a break and sent All Things Breast Cancer to detention for a while. Well I have had some issues with excessive bruising from Zoladex and am hoping I can get some input from women who have switched from Zoladex to Lupron. I started the injections about 7 months ago. The first32 were uneventful. Very minimal pain and slight bruising (maybe the size of 2 quarters side by side). The title of my thread says \"excessive.\" So then came the 4th injection. I ended up had a dark purple-ish red bruise about the size of a dollar bill. It faded within about 5-7 days and was unnoticeable by 2 weeks. The nurse thought the bruising was because we had done two months in a row on that side (the left is quite painful for me). Well August has been a holy nightmare. We kept with the alternating of sides and it was left ab jab this time. First, it hurt like HELL when the nurse gave it to me. It felt like I had been harpooned! Then it started to bleed like I had never seen, including all over the waist of my pants and on my shirt. I could see the bruise forming as she was trying to stop the bleeding. By the time I got home, I had to strip down to my underwear as anything touching my abdomen was painful. The bruise was deep purple-blue-red and was about 6x8 inches (yes inches, not cm). I started popping tylenol and icing every hour. It has been 3 weeks, and I still have some peripheral bruising which has faded to a light yellow with a few splotches of purple-red. I also have a hard 1 inch-ish sized lump that feels like a marble where the injection was given, and it is quite tender. Also the pressure on the lump when I bend over is uncomfortable. I sent a picture to my MO as the clinic says \"bruising is normal.\" She suggested icing before or using the lidocaine cream. Not sure how that has anything to do with bruising. She also said I could switch to Lupron. I had been having some pain along the hip area on my abdomen (same size of the injection bruise). I thought it was a tight/overused hip flexor or strained muscle from my new found friend the Peloton and my poor habit of sitting too much working from home. After more than 6 weeks of this, and no resolve from rest/ice/stretching, I saw my pcp last week. She took one look at my bruise I said it was anything BUT normal. She questions whether the injection was given properly. When she heard I had bruised similarly a few months prior, she ordered a CT to rule out intra-abdominal hemorrhaging. She is wondering if I have been having internal bruising or bleed leaking into my muscles which she said it can be very painful and slow to heal. My CT is tomorrow, and I am hoping we get some answers as to what this pain is. Meanwhile, I have rescheduled next week's injection at the infusion center. I am hoping they are less rushed than the clinic and will administer properly. I am also considering switching to Lupron. My MO said it will be given in my ass. Nice. Nervous about a sore ass now.

To take it in the first place or not. To keep taking it or not. Everyone's point of view is valid. It's a really tough decision. If my situation was different, I might not still be taking it. I thought I would tell my story today to explain why I'm still taking an AI. In the fall of 2019, I woke up one morning and discovered that my right nipple had completed inverted. I have slightly inverted nipples in the first place, so I was only mildly concerned. No lumps or bumps, no pain, no redness, no rash. All good. A few weeks later it seemed as though half my boob was sucked in, and I had the beginnings of a sore on the outside. At this point I was pretty sure it was cancer. I didn't have any insurance and at 63 I wouldn't get medicare for another 18 months or so. Knowing that cancer treatment is very expensive, after discussing the pros and cons with my husband, I decided not to seek either a diagnosis or treatment. We'd discuss it again when I was 65. I felt fine. Over the following months, the sores on my breast got worse. In August 2020 (5 months before I could get medicare), I suddenly found myself in the hospital with a severe stomach infection. The doctor was more concerned about my breast than my stomach. He did extract a promise from me to at least get a mammogram when I got out of the hospital. Since I didn't have any insurance, the social worker at the hospital called me in my hospital room and asked permission to seek financial aid for me. Somehow, she got my hefty hospital bill taken care of and signed me up for the women's health medicaid program for breast and cervical cancer and told me not to worry about a thing. On September 4th, I got my very first mammogram ever, immediately followed by an ultrasound. On Sept. 11th, I had a biopsy and waited in the exam room for the results. Of course, I had advanced cancer. IDC, hormone positive. I was assigned an oncologist and my case went to the tumor board. It turned out that the medicaid program goes back and pays from the date of initial diagnosis, so I was refunded the money I had paid up front for my mammogram, ultrasound and biopsy. I got a port and started my chemo on October 4th and finished at the end of December. I had a decent response to the chemo. The main tumors shrunk a little as well as the too small to biopsy nodules in my lung. At that time, the tumor board recommended I take just letrozole for 6 months to see what kind of response I would have. After the 6 months, everything had shrunk a little more and nearly half my lung nodules were gone. Surgery was a given considering the significant skin involvement but the letrozole had shrunk my main tumors down enough to be offered a lumpectomy instead of a mastectomy. I had a mastectomy and 11 nodes removed. The tumor board recommended radiation, so I had that too. I've been taking letrozole for nearly 2 years now. My scans this week were clear. For the first time, my MO declared me cancer free. It's surreal. I still will have regular follow ups and scans of course, but it looks really good. So, even though I have joint pain, trigger fingers, fatigue, dry eye, dry mouth (dry everything really), night sweats, occasional nausea, digestive issues, and brain fog - I take my letrozole every day. I'll keep on taking it because for me, I think it's one of the reasons I'm alive today. Will I have a recurrence or a new cancer? Who knows. It's always a possibility. I really think it's just a crapshoot. On a side note, I'm grateful for the medicare program which pays a good portion of my treatment expenses and the state medicaid program which picks up the slack. I hope everyone has a peaceful and happy Thanksgiving.", "Details": ""},

The long list of side effects for this drug includes \"digestive problems\", but I cannot seem to find any more detail as to what those \"digestive problems\" might be specifically or how frequently they might occur in people who take this drug. I began taking letrozole in January and since last August I have had a lot of upper stomach pain, loss of appetite, and even symptoms that are similar to panic attacks sometimes, when food just enters and hits my stomach. My whole body can go weak and I double over with a real bad dull ache (not stabbing pain). The doctors I've seen all seem to think it relates to stomach acid and one said that it sounds like a classic ulcer. It may well be just an \"everyday ulcer\" (I've never had one before), but I am also beginning to wonder if what I am experiencing isn't just another awful side effect of letrozole. I was given H2 blockers (famotodine/Pepcid) that helped a little, but not completely - it also made me sick with side effects (freaky, kept waking up at night, and more.) Since that did not help I actually went to the ER and they did a CT scan of the area and saw nothing out of the ordinary. They gave me a PPI (omeprazole/Prilosec). That too seemed to help some, and more than the H2 blocker did, but it also made me really sick (breathing trouble, feeling \"emotionless\", weird, creepy, not really here, etc.). After reading online reviews, I read that a lot of people prefer Gaviscon, that it can help with ulcers, and I saw no complaints about awful side effects like I did with the other drugs. I took it for three days and again it seemed to help initially, but then I got all out of whack and read how it can mess with your electrolytes because of the aluminum and calcium in it. I stopped taking it, and have felt much better overall since then (a couple of days now), but still have this feeling that there is a sandbag in my stomach and that I am always full, with food causing upset when I eat. The doctors suggested a longer period on the acid preventing drugs, but I simply cannot do that due to all of the side effects. During this time, I have also been trying a lot of home remedies, such as DGL, raw sauerkraut, and raw honey with nigella sativa powder. Again, all of these things seem to help some, but not completely. I have gotten relief from just occasional heartburn in the past with these home remedies. I am back to wondering if stomach acid or an ulcer is really the problem. I did not have many of the standard ulcer symptoms like nausea and vomiting. There is no indication that blood is involved in any way. I just have this chronic feeling of heaviness and fullness in my stomach that food sometimes puts into something of a spasm, and this \"total body\" out of sorts feeling that can come with it all sometimes. The only thing the doctors will do next is an upper endoscopy and I would like to avoid that at almost any cost. All of my other tests have indicated that I am basically fine and stable for now. Before I get to the point of having to schedule more tests with doctors, etc. I would really like to know if any others taking letrozole have experienced stomach and digestive issues, what they were like, and if they could likely be attributed to the drug.

I had to wait an hour past appointment time (past closing time, the reception desk people left before I even got to see my MO) because she had pushed back her appointments for 2 earlier people who went to the wrong buildings and were over an hour late for her, so at this point I was already tired and probably overly-sensitive. She seemed very competent in terms of medical analyses (read her report) but she was impatient when I got teary about my fears of recurrence (she said \"you're basically curable, why are you crying?\" re: hopefully stage 1 grade 2 diagnosis. This was 2 weeks after my diagnosis so I was still prone to small fits of crying when talking about my cancer to people especially when thinking about long-term (20+ years) recurrence rates/survival since I'm relatively young. She then mentioned how she had patients that she had to talk to whose breasts were so filled with cancer that treatment was ASAP (comparing my relative \"easy\" diagnosis). What made me uncomfortable is that she remarked that she didn't understand why I even had the appointment before surgery (the patient coordinator set up my appointments, so I had no control or knowledge on which doctors I was supposed to be seeing after my initial biopsy cancer diagnosis) and then she suggested that I could see an MO closer to home at a local hospital satellite office -- hospital main building is about 1.5 hrs away from where I live. I am not sure if my feeling that she didn't want me as a patient is insecurity or based on fact from this. I looked up the MOs at that satellite office and none of them are part of the breast oncology department like she is. When I read her report on my visit, she had also gotten my ethnicity wrong (She put down a totally different Asian ethnicity than what I had told her), my cat's name (not important since I guess it was an attempt at chitchat). Am I being too picky? She has a lot of really good reviews though about 10% of them talk about her being dismissive / unwelcoming. I know it's not a popularity contest and I should be more concerned about the competence of my MO than her bedside manners, but I didn't feel 100% comfortable with her unlike my surgeon, but that could just have been because it was first meeting and she thought it was an unnecessary one (I thought it would be good for Q&A about my concerns about treatment post-surgery but she was kind of dismissive about my concerns about radiation and Tamoxifen).

The last is a link to a podcast about the book, where the authors both argue that the alleged dangers of HRT after menopause desperately need to be reexamined and reconsidered, and they do discuss that for breast cancer survivors as well at the end. https://peterattiamd.com/caroltavris-avrumbluming/ I know, it's everything we've been told to fear and avoid like the plague, and I am certainly much less sure about that now, especially since I'm currently suffering through abject misery related to onset of menopause. The research is cited throughout and it is an academic work, not some sketchy quack nonsense. Believe me, I'm the last person to go against science and medical treatment, but that's the point of his work, pushing for scientific questioning of current (but likely incomplete and outdated) thought and practice related to menopause.

Today I turned up at the GP surgery for my pre-booked Zoladex implant, and was suddenly told by the nurse that I've been changed to a different drug! (\"Prostap 3 dcs\" - I think it's primarily for prostate cancer in men, hence the name. I was the nurse's only female patient on Zoladex, all the rest were men. I suspect that's the reason for the change, administrative convenience, but who knows.) I asked why the change, but could get no explanation from the GP nurse, she just said the Oncologist at the hospital approved it. I asked why, when i had been told by my Onc that Zoladex with Letrazole is the most effective combination of therapies for my particular cancer and for my age, and again the nurse evaded answering the question. She insisted it was exactly the same drug as Zoladex. But having looked it up since the appointment, it's not the same drug at all. It still shuts my ovaries down which is what Zoladex is supposed to do, but it's a different medication, administered in a different way and with some different side effects/warnings. It's supposed to be preceded by and used alongside regular hormone blood tests too, but I've had none since my mastectomy over a year ago. It's impossible to get hold of my Oncologist to ask why the change and what to expect, so I feel a bit lost. It's taken me months to get used to the side effects of the Zoladex (in combination with Letrazole aka Femara) and to literally have to plan my life around the timing of the worst of those side effects. So I'm a bit peeved at the change without any information or notice. It's also the fifth different combination of hormone therapies I've been on since December, each combo bringing different and pretty horrible side effects. I can't bear all the changes, I just want some kind of regularity so I can live my life. It'll take me yet another 6 months to identify repeating patterns of side effects of this new drug, or the rate at which this wears off between injections, and how to manage the difficulties those create. Has anyone else had Leuprorelin injections for their breast cancer? Do you know anything about it? What's your experience been like?

I was not menopausal when I began it and had a Mirena coil inserted at the same time to combat possible side effects of womb lining build-up after a couple of polyps were found and removed. This, of course, stopped my periods and it was only a blood test last summer that revealed that I am likely menopausal with an FSH level of 36. I've had a very good time on Tamoxifen, have felt extremely well, and barely any symptoms apart from some initial pain in my tailbone, strangely. I've also had minimal menopause symptoms apart from periods of hot flushes but generally, they are manageable. A little anxiety too. All of my friends are having terrible times with their menopauses and I've wondered for a while whether the combo of Tamoxifen and the coil have somehow staved off full-blown symptoms that everyone else seems to be having around me. So my anxiety is about what will happen to me when I stop taking Tamoxifen and have the Mirena removed, but I can't find any info from health professionals anywhere. All there is was a thread on one of the breast cancer forums where people are detailing horrific experiences of coming off treatment, awful meno-type responses, anxiety, pain, etc and I am now really scared about stopping. My doctor just poo-poos it and says nothing will happen, but why am I reading all this stuff then? Can anyone point me in the direction of information about why typically happens when stopping this hormone treatment and what I can expect, please? Part of me thinks I should just stay on it and keep the coil (tho in theory this won't be working well 6 years on), but my doctor and oncologist say come off. I just don't want to be plunged into awful menopause by doing so. Thanks for reading!", "Details": ""},

Just a little back ground, I was diagnosed over a year ago, completed all my recommended procedures (surgery, chemo, radiation, tamoxifen) all good one year later according to my annual mammogram and ultrasound results and feel as though I never even had cancer let alone endured the subsequent treatments which followed. I realise I'm very fortunate and despite some initial issues with Tamoxifen - I believe I suffer no side effects apart from hot flushes. My query is, when I spoke with the head of breast surgery (not my actual surgeon) regarding the results of my mammogram and ultrasound, he mentioned I'll benefit from only five years of the medicine due to new information revealing 7 years on Tamoxifen yielded no additional benefits. He's not my oncologist so I smiled and waited for my oncology appointment. My oncologist has stated, he wishes for me to remain on Tamoxifen for another year or two, then switch to an AI with additional ovarian suppression / removal. My oncologist believes this treatment is superior compared to Tamoxifen, apparently this switch is due to the fact my age in two years will align with the average age of most post menopausal women. I left his office informing my oncologist we may all be dead by then so let's not make plans. I guess I feel, since I'm tolerating Tamoxifen so well and my cervical lining and ovaries are excellent at the moment, why would I switch? Why do you suppose the breast surgeon recommended Tamoxifen for five years? Should I listen to my gut and insist I remain on Tamoxifen? Will the Oncologist refuse to treat me if I do so (I'm in the public system). Is it common for patients who've been treated successfully for BC refuse their on oncologist's recommendations? Am I getting ahead of myself? Anyopinions would be very much appreciated💗💗💗.

By depression, I don't mean being a little down or teary eyed but worse than that. I won't call it severe but it is getting to that level. A few weeks after starting the drug I started to experience depression, joint/muscle pain and extreme fatigue. At the start of month two my oncologist recommended I take a two week break from the drug due to what I was experiencing and then start back up, taking every other day for a week. During the two week break, things were better but now that I started up again, the side effects are back. The oncologist says he can switch me to to the other drug and maybe it will be different even though the side effects listed are the same. As I said, this is not just being a little down. It is affecting my daily life and I am often times just crying all day and night. I did not experience any of that prior to starting this drug. I can deal with the joint/muscle pain as I do that anyway with my auto immune condition but the depression and fatigue I cannot continue like this and I'm terrified of not being able to take this drug for the 5-10 years they tell me I need to. I am wondering if others experienced this and if these side effects got better after taking the drug for a while or what you have done to help with the depression, fatigue and muscle/joint pain.

I'm 42, I've been taking Tamoxifen for over a year now and so far, no side effects really, just the occassional hot flash. Suddenly about 3 weeks ago, my scalp just started itching. The itchiness lead me to notice I've been scratching it and suddenly my hair has changed texture and has gotten noticably thinner. Now let me say I had BRAVE hair. Tons and Tons of red curls that was coarse and heavy. I loved my hair... If I tried to use a ponytail it was a very thick one. Suddenly my hair is limp and if I try to put it in a ponytail, I would say the radius is about half what it used to be. And my damn head is still itchy. I went to a salon yesterday. 1) I do NOT have any flakes. 2) I do not have any redness, or irritation on my scalp per my stylist. 3) she detected nothing at all to warrant all this itching. I want my freaking hair back. I can lose the boobs - no problem... but the hair? I need it back. I think I'd do better if this was chemo because at least you know the cause and that it will end. Why is my hair falling out? ugh. Steps I'm taking: 1) I've been taking 10,000 mcg Biotin since I noticed for about 3 weeks. 2) I just bought Nioxin level 4 for thinning hair. 3) I just ordered Rogaine for Women 5%. 4) I have a call in to my doctor to get some blood work and see if there's a blood issue. (low iron, low thyriod etc.)... I've never had issues before with my hair. If the Tamoxifen suddenly after 1 year is making my hair fall out and change... I may stop taking it if I can't find a solution. The itching is driving me crazy. Lastly, the only other thing I changed up the last month was I had a massage therapist work on me and she'd massage my scalp with some lotion of hers... Maybe it changed due to that? Anybody had something like that? I need to solve this mystery and I figured I'd keep y'all posted on my results and what I discover. My hair is a huge part of my identity so I've been depressed in a way I've never experienced before. Yikes. Oncotype =20, ER 95%, PR 5%, ki67= 30%, Mammoprint = Low, Blueprint = Luminal A!!!!

Here’s my laundry list of SEs since then. Vaginal discharge, not bloody, and tolerable. Intermittent pelvic pain and cramping, mild and tolerable. In mid-August, I noticed pain in my left hip joint making it painful to climb stairs and walk uphill. By December this had spread to my left buttock and lower back and I had pain bending or twisting. Aleve, my pain drug of choice, did no good. I had my hip x-rayed, no problems found in joint and I was given a steroid shot for possible bursitis. It did no good. I had a back MRI which found several longstanding problems, (disc slippage, bulging and stenosis) due to wear and tear and being 70 years old. I started PT about a month ago and see progress in that I can bend and twist and climb stairs better. Other SEs: depression, moodiness, crankiness, and hopelessness; general fatigue and lack of energy. AND, finally, in mid-December I began to notice my hair thinning and this continues. I’ve seen my oncologist twice since starting T and discussed with him all the SE’s I’ve mentioned. He conceded the depression, hair thinning and tiredness could be attributed to T, and did an iron test, which showed no deficiency. Recommended an anti-depressant; says back pain is not due to T. I asked if T came in lower doses; he said no. Based on what I’ve read on these blogs and others, it’s obvious that many women either quit T (and the other anti-estrogen drugs) entirely, or reduce their dosage, regardless of what their onco says. I’m considering halving my dosage, and I’m considering Rogaine. I do have some concern about deviating from the standard because I had micrometastesis in one lymph node out of two. My Onco DX score is 17, so chemotherapy was ruled out (thank god). I’d love to get feedback from anyone who lowered her T dosage or quit it.

Question : Do any of you take supplements for heart health due to AI use and were those supplements suggested by a medical professional? For COGNITIVE functions, I asked about a cognitive/memory test that could provide a baseline score and then show any changes in about 18 months. The oncologist said no one had ever requested one.

Question : Do any of you take cognitive supplements due to AI use and were those supplements suggested by a medical professional? For BONES , the standard bone scan was suggested now and in about 18 months. The oncologist made sure I was taking calcium and suggested I add 1000 IUs of Vitamin D3 in gel form.

For CHOLESTEROL , it was suggested a lipids panel be done in about 18 months to compare with recent numbers. The Letrozole packaging insert says it may increase cholesterol and older studies showed substantial increases with Letrozole, but newer studies seemed to show less or no cholesterol increase. I asked about my cholesterol, which has inched up over the last decade to the high end of normal, but is very good for the ratio of good to bad. The oncologist agreed with my suggestion of eating steel cut oats (which have sadly slipped from my diet, shame on me). She also suggested losing 5-10 pounds to drop cholesterol. I am not at all overweight and am well within normal on height/weight chart. But losing 5-10 lbs would not make me underweight. She agreed it would be very hard to lose 5-10 lbs.

I had a lumpectomy with very clean margins and 16 rounds of whole breast radiation. The radiologist told me the \"boost\" of 5 additional doses to the tumor bed was not warranted. Luckily I did not have to have chemo. My BCS told me that due to my genetic report (no mutations) that the risk of a NEW breast cancer (occurrence) was 1% per year. I've run Predict, LifeMath, and the Tufts model etc. since my tumor was too small to qualify for Oncotype, to get a general idea of my absolute risk of recurrence and the benefit of hormone therapy. The models all show a benefit of less than 1% by adding hormone therapy. NCCN Guidelines state to \"Consider\" Endocrine Therapy. My MO wants me to try it but is respectful of whatever choice I make. I asked my MO about the calculations from the models and he said those are just algorithms and don't really apply, and when I pinned him down to give me a ballpark recurrence rate, he told me 5%. So what I am grappling with is the benefit of a hormone blocker is @ 50% from what he said - so a risk reduction of 2.5%. In looking at only the serious side effects, broken out by how common they are, and/or things that could be deadly and could happen quickly. Very Common (>10%) for the AIs - Cardiovascular Disease, Other Cardiac Event (and to a lesser degree Hypertension which is a problem for me with a Hx of Hypertensive Crisis from Meds). Common (1-10%) for the AIs - Cerebrovascular Accident, Cerebral Ischemia, Cerebral Infarct, Angina, Coronary Heart Disease, Myocardial Ischemia, Myocardial Infarction, Cardiac Failure, Stroke, Lympedema, TIA, Neoplasm, Secondary Malignancy/Other Primary Cancer. Tamoxifen - DVT, Microvascular Thrombosis, Pulmonary Embolism, Stroke This doesn't include the higher risk of Diabetes (I already have pre-diabetes) and High Cholesterol (which I am prone to but which is now normal due to hard work with diet/exercise) or the very real but not life-threatening issues of bone pain, anxiety, depression, etc. I've pretty much ruled out the AIs since my Achilles heel is in the Cardio area, and because I have Osteoporosis and adding drugs like Zometa, etc. add another layer of potentially serious side effects. I will obviously talk to my MO about this but just trying to see if how I am looking at this is appropriate. Studies I have read say to estimate the net effect of the intervention on the absolute risk of each of the relevant outcomes, one needs to know the relative risk of the intervention but also the absolute risk of the health outcome in absence of the intervention. It seems that this is what I have done and it seems to show the risk outweighs the benefit. But I consider if I got a recurrence I would regret not taking anything, although I have read enough to know that recurrences happen even when people take these drugs. I also consider how I would feel if something devastating happened and/or I did irreparable permanent damage to my body for such a small risk reduction. Some of these things like the cardiac risks are long-term effects that can happen years down the road. Any things I am not considering?

I tried to go over the serious side effects with him, but like with the other MOs he kind of skimmed over things and minimized their likelihood. Seems common with MOs, the last one I saw did the same thing - actually wouldn't even discuss them with me, just wanted to prescribe one. Dr. Susan Love said this is common with oncologists, even though anti-estrogen therapy can be as toxic as chemo, the side effects are often glossed over, probably because no one would take them if they knew. In any case I looked at the drug contraindications today for Tamoxifen and other than the handful of drugs where the contraindication was additive for liver damage or kidney damage, the majority of the drugs noted the possibility of Long QT syndrome. In reading the Professional version of the rationale, it seems there are many, many drugs (over 300) which include some very common OTC drugs - Pepcid, Immodium, colonoscopy prep, propofol (which was used during my lumpectomy and is also used during colonoscopy) and some very common antibiotics, etc. that have this potential to exacerbate the Long QT Prolongation cause by Tamoxifen. Long QT Syndrome can cause Ventricular Arrhythmia, which is quickly fatal in the great majority of cases. Non-pharacologic additive risk factors are age (older), being female, and having bradycardia or slow heart rate, which I have (it's most often right at 50). https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29720397/ Given this, I don't feel comfortable taking this until I can talk to my cardiologist about this. Unfortunately he doesn't do virtual visits, and he's very hard to get in to see. I also can talk to the pharmacist, but she of course doesn't know my cardiac history. So I either just take it and risk something serious and potentially fatal, wait until I can get an appt with my cardiologist, or call my MO and ask to be put on an AI instead.

I have been eating this way for 7 years now ever since a diagnosis of pre-diabetes because I wanted to halt/reverse the disease and not go on meds, which has worked. I have maintained perfect weight and blood glucose levels during this time. There is lots of emerging research that Keto helps in the fight against cancer. Whether that is true or not, I want to continue to eat the same way I have been to maintain my health aside from cancer. I have just read, however, that impaired liver function is a contraindication for Keto as the ketones are produced by the liver and the liver produces more bile due to the higher fat macros of a Keto diet. Since it seems that all the hormone blockers have a side effect of elevated liver enzymes and other liver side effects, I wonder if I will be able to stay on this diet. Is there such a thing as a nutritional oncologist that I could bring in if my MO doesn't know or want to get into the nutritional aspects of my care? Unfortunately, many of the professionals I have seen think that Keto is some harmful fad, which when used correctly as a lifestyle modification it is not, it is incredibly healthy.

We then decided to increase my dose to 15mg for a month, at the end of which then repeat the Endoxifen level test. I got the exact same result as the previous time! At this point, I found an article that said that higher levels of Curcumin (or Turmeric) could interfere with Tamoxifen effectiveness.

The backstory is that when I was diagnosed the BCS was on vacation and I couldn't get in for 3 weeks, so I saw the PA who I loved. She told me at that meeting that I had to choose my team, and gave me a list of MOs, and Radiation Therapists. She told me that they would review my case the following Thurs, so I needed to at least pick by then. Long story short, I picked a Radiation Therapist that I love, and went to an MO that 2 of my neighbors recommended. I was not that impressed with him. He didn't really talk all that much, although he was amenable to treatment options which I like, even a reduced dose of Tamoxifen if that was the only alternative to me taking treatment. I met with one more MO to compare at a different practice, who I liked better, but was not completely sold on. So a PA at the first practice got me in to see another MO there who she said was very open to questions, very deliberate, very respectful of people's choices, etc. I met with him once, and was really put off that he wouldn't let me tape the meeting (he told me he found it \"offensive\"), which I found odd because all the other MOs and my breast surgeon had let me. It was especially upsetting because this practice does not allow visitors so my husband was not with me. So today was me 2nd meeting with him to go over my path report, my Oncotype results, and I THOUGHT to go over things like recurrence rates, and how that related to treatment in terms of both relative risk and absolute. Well... he told me \"he did not have time\" to go over recurrence rates, and he'd look up that information and someone could send it to me, but he wasn't going to take the time during this meeting to go over it. When I asked about relative risk vs absolute risk, and wanted to clarify if I understood, he said \"it's a simple mathematical equation\" and went back to looking at his laptop. He then TOLD me he would start me on an AI but I would have radiation first. NO discussion of why an AI vs Tamoxifen, or discussion about the side effects as it relates to my medical history. When I tried to talk to him about the contraindications I had read about on Mayo Clinic site many of which I have - kidney disease, high blood pressure, osteoporosis, he was VERY dismissive and basically said that's the combo I use and I'll put you on another drug to deal with the bone loss. There was NO discussion, no back and forth, it was VERY uncomfortable. Then he told me that he \"had to go, he had other patients\" after 20 min, so I picked up my things and left. I was about in tears walking to the elevator. I have been reading Dr. Susan Love's book. I took my cue from her as to what to expect and what to ask. She said to ask your MO about recurrence risk, and how much benefit YOU would get from taking the drugs, and that the benefit is directly related to your risk of recurrence. Was I wrong to expect that an MO would go over this with me? I am so upset right now, I can't even think straight... I will not be able to see anyone else at this practice - they don't allow it. I can't even go back to the original guy that at least answered my questions. My only hope is to try to get in with the 2nd guy I saw at a different practice, but I don't know how he'd feel since I cancelled my follow-up with him, thinking this guy would be a better fit. I just can't stay with anyone who doesn't answer my questions and is put off by me asking any. Even my breast surgeon who is SUPER busy entertains questions and is very considerate and compassionate. Same with my radiation oncologist. When I met with the breast cancer surgeon the first time, she said she never would have picked the first MO I went to based on my personality and recommended someone entirely different.

I've read that once you start a bisphosphonate you can't stop it, or your fracture risk goes way up. Is that true? 3). What is the deal with dental work? No one knows what they are going to need to have done for dental work within a 5 year timeframe. What can/can not be done and what is the risk? 4). The one thing I did find out today (after much prodding) was that if a person has taken birth control pills and not had a blood clot, then their risk of blood clots with Tamoxifen is very low.

{"Title": "Tamoxifen vs Aromatase Inhibitors and Safety", "Post-Data": "Posted on: Oct 3, 2021 06:01PM macdebbie", "Post": "I've just completed my surgery and am seeing my MO for my 2nd appt (the first was just a meet and greet about a month ago). A little background - I met with 3 MOs. The first one is at the same practice as the one I chose, which has caused some controversy (it's not usually allowed to choose another from the same practice - not sure why, since chemistry is a big piece of the pie). Anyway, the first 2 MOs I met with said that they would likely give me Tamoxifen due to the fact that I already have osteoporosis. The 3rd MO (the one I chose) said that he would likely give me an AI because the side effect with Tamoxifen were much more serious - blood clots and uterine cancer. He made this statement to me after reviewing my entire medical history. However, I have done some reading, and there are numerous studies that show that AIs have a very high rate of severe cardiac events compared to Tamoxifen, namely and 86% increased risk of heart failure, and a 50% increased risk of cardiovascular mortality and that the FDA required a label change on Anastrozole. The study I read (and there are others) indicated that many clinicians aren't aware of these cardiac complications or don't take them into account. I already have numerous cardiac issues. I have diabetes, so already am at risk of cardiac events. I also have high blood pressure, which I have had since I was a skinny 100 lb 20 year old, so I think it's genetic and possibly something to do with my kidneys since my dad died at 32 of kidney failure. In any case, I have been on a beta blocker for the last 25 years or so, and my blood pressure has been well controlled. However, I am extremely sensitive to meds, and ended up in the ER in stroke territory with BP of 286/185 from 2 days on Cipro for a UTI. Weird things like that happen to me. I also have first degree heart block from the Atenolol, and have bradycardia and tachycardia with SVT events. I have been in the ER many times with my heart racing after being woken up from a dead sleep. So now I am worried.... I wonder if I made a mistake and should have stuck with the 1st MO who although I thought was a little arrogant, told me he would work with me on the meds (we were talking about Tamoxifen) and said \"we don't not go in the pool due to fear, and if we have to first dip our toe in the water, so be it\". I just don't want the MO to look at this in a vacuum and treat the cancer, without regard for the potential of devastating consequences. Given my cardiac issues and my osteoporosis, it seems that Tamoxifen is the safer/better drug for me. Because aside from the cardiac issues with AIs, I would also have to go on a drug like Fosomax or similar due to my osteoporosis and then were are adding even more potential side effects. Am I going to have a say in this? I should. It's my life. If someone told me I had a 3% greater change of uterine cancer and a 1.5% greater chance of blood clots with Tamoxifen, or an 83% greater chance of cardiac events that could kill me with an AI, I know which one I'd choose. I also like that Tamoxifen has been around for ages, so is well studied. With AIs, not so much. There's still a lot that they don't know. Ugh... and I thought surgery was the hard part. I know that surgery came with risks, but I didn't have a choice. That's why I chose lumpectomy, to lower my risks under anesthesia, recovery, complications, etc. And with radiation I don't have a choice either. I know I can get another type of cancer, and there is a risk of lung damage, and heart damage. From what I've read that risk could be lowered with Proton Therapy, but I don't even know if my insurance would pay for that, or how I would be able to travel to a treatment center for the treatment, since the nearest is 4 hours away and we can't afford to live in a hotel for 6 weeks. But hormone therapy, which most of the doctors who have brought it up gloss over the side effects, seems now like a big deal, and one that could really affect my life - and even shorten it. So if hormone therapy lowers my risk by say 5%, is it worth an 86% increase in a serious cardiac event??", "Details": ""},

If so how did it go and what did you do about it? I have had increased limb tingling (arms and legs, hands and feet) along with sore feet and very achy and stiff legs - to the point where I have had short periods of difficulty standing and walking. On a couple of occasions it even reached a super scary mode where I was thinking that if it got any worse I could become paralyzed and not even be able to get to a medical place (I live alone). I had a bad episode last Sunday afternoon, although not as bad as the one a week previous to that, so I went to the urgent care yesterday. They ran a few tests but did not find anything particularly alarming going on. They did an ECG and blood work. I told them I had had similar symptoms before, that turned out to be dehydration and/or electrolyte imbalances (low sodium and potassium) and that when the low electrolytes were addressed, the problems cleared up. They said my sodium was a bit low, but not worrisome, and the potassium was OK this time. I'm also experiencing real tight chest and back muscles that some have suggested is costochondritis, but I'm wondering if the letrozole is causing this too. The tingling in my arms gets worse when I type and I've read that letrozole can cause carpel tunnel that causes tingling in the arms at least (still have the tingling legs too). Typing also really aggravates my chest and back muscle tightness and again, I've see that that can be costochondritis related. I've been to the ER before for the tight chest muscles and they said it was indeed muscles. I also have some neuropathy/tingling in hands and feet that has continued ever since the Paclitaxel, but when it moves up my whole limbs, I'm inclined to think it is more than the residual neuropathy. The urgent care place said they don't know a whole lot about the cancer treatment effects, but that they weren't seeing anything that would sound an alarm bell. I seem to have become one big tingling body/joint ache that waxes and wanes a bit. I have recently read on a menopause site (not a letrozole side effect site) that low estrogen can cause body tingling, although it might be a less common and less known menopause/low estrogen symptom. The rationale was that estrogen is related to lubrication that protects nerve endings and that that can be lessened or disappear with low estrogen, hence the tingling. Letrozole could also be the cause of the body aches and tight muscles, but I just have no way of knowing what's what. All of this tingling, stiffness, and aching/tight muscles seem to be getting worse and I just don't know at what point it becomes more than just a side effect to put up with vs something really scary and not good at all. Worst case scenario it could be cancer spread to the spine, but at this point, everything I know is suggesting letrozole and/or costochondritis, i.e. musculoskeletal causes. I did have a chest x-ray as recently as April (that I understand shows the spine) and it was all good. I would greatly appreciate anybody's thoughts and comments about this. I'm trying to get a follow up with my surgeon soon and will bring all this up with her, but in the meantime am getting pretty worried and even scared at times.", "Details": ""},

There seems to be a growing trend in urging women to continue AI's beyond 5 years. This provides food for thought against that argument, as it looks like for older women at least, the risk of heart problems may well go up after 4 years: https://www.thebreastonline.com/article/S0960-9776(21)00412-4/fulltext#%252 Interesting that these researchers also believe that these AI's should be tested against a \"clean\" population that has not already been on some other sort of endocrine therapy. I'm no scientist and no medical researcher, but it has continued to baffle me as to why all of the research on AI's is compared to those on Tamoxifen, and then all of the research on Tamoxifen was compared to those on other drugs at the time. That has to have created all sorts of confounding factors and hence, unclear results. There are so many who voluntarily decline these treatments that it shouldn't be difficult to get around the ethical concern that is always noted with regard to why there is no straight head to head study of people on AI's vs no endocrine treatment at all. These researchers do note limitations to their study of course, and this is just one study, not definitive, but I think it is illuminating and again underscores the need for finding an alternative to these estrogen deprivation treatments.", "Details": ""},

I scoured the tamoxifen threads and didn't find much related to this topic, so I thought I would start it. I'm 53 and an avid runner, cyclist and fitness instructor (in addition to my full-time job in advertising) and I was wondering if any of you have had issues with intense athletic endeavors and tamoxifen. I ran my first half marathon since my BC treatment yesterday. I've been on tamoxifen for 7 months and ironically took a break about 3 weeks ago do to sweling in my feet and ankles that was making running uncomfortable. I'm happy to say that after only 4 days off the tamoxifen the sweeling went down. However, I had the worst half marathon of my life yesterday. At about the 11 mile mark, I developed a severe cramp in my left calf (like the charlie horses I started having at night almost immediately after I started tamoxifen). I slowed to a walk, thinking I could walk it off, only it quickly went into my shin, then my ankle and finally my feet. My toes were literally curled inside my running shoes. THen it started up in the other leg. I hobbled the last two miles (but managed a slow run to cross the finish line, 'cuz I wasn't gonna cross it walking!) I was as hydrated as I would normally be for a run; in fact, I made more frequent water stops than usual, opting for Gatorade instead of water, specifically to avoid the possibility of cramping. I have NEVER cramped on a run, or even a 70 mile bike ride in my life, so I'm thinking it had to be the tamoxifen. I'm going to need a strategy for my next half...like going off this nasty drug maybe for a full month before race day. I'm sure my onc would be appalled but this is what I love and how I am battling the weight gain from tamoxifen. Anyone else have a similar experience? Sara", "Details": ""},

I went out for a walk this morning (I usually walk every day) and since then, I can barely walk or stand for more than a few minutes at a time, and that's not my usual experience. The neuropathy (from Taxol presumably) is also worse and just a few minutes ago I dropped an almost full jar of instant coffee on the floor (I've \"regressed\" to instant due to the fatigue, etc. of the cancer treatments), and it was really hard to clean up the mess; coffee grounds, small glass shards, etc. It set me back and the aches and pains increased along with the inability to stand or walk for very long. My limbs feel weak and a bit tingly too. I get more hot flashes and \"freaky feelings\" too. I check my vitals at home, and they are all fine. At first I thought I was just having an anxiety reaction to having to have my apartment complex's lenders and insurance adjusters come in and take pictures of my apartment (not just mine, all the apts), because it is a cluttered mess, and I was embarrassed.

If you are having knee pain as a SE of the AI meds, it might work for you too! I am on Femara which for maybe four months caused me no problems whatsoever, but then I developed some fairly bad knee pain. I used to take fish oil, a few years ago, pre-BC. The fish oil made me feel better overall and whenever I was on them my cholesterol numbers looked much better too because I had higher levels of \"good\" cholesterol. Anyway, I went back on them and was amazed to have the knee pain disappear. I'm taking two small capsules per day of molecularly distilled (free of mercury, free of fishy aftertaste) fish oil, 1000 mg total (for the two pills), of which 680 mg is Omega -3s and the rest is EPA/DHA/other.

Had mastectomy on the affected breast and started taking tamoxifen. Recently, I went to see a gynecologist and she tested my hormone level. My estrogen came back extremely high (she said she's never seen anyone that high before) at 1,046 when normal should be below 300. I haven't ever had my hormone tested before so I don't know if this was caused by tamoxifen or if it has always been high. My gynecologist recommends ovary removal but she said it also carries the risk of heart disease and bone loss so she is not pushing for it strongly either. I asked about Lupron and Zolodex but she said she does not prescribe Lupron for more than 6 months. I asked my onco but he does not seem concerned at all about my high estrogen level. I am worried my high estrogen will cause my breast cancer to come back or cause ovarian cancer but I don't want to remove my ovaries either due to risk of heart disease. I have a few questions in my mind that I am not clear about: 1) Does tamoxifen increase estrogen level? I know it blocks the effects of estrogen on breast tissue but does it also increase the estrogen level? There is an article in breastcancer.org that seems to suggest that it does. If so, has any of you had experience with your doctor recommending you stop taking it due to high estrogen? 2) How did your doctor decide to prescribe Lupron or Zolodex for you? It seems that hormone level testing is not usually done and I don't know why. Did your onco order the hormone level testing then decided you needed Lupron or Zolodex? 3) What are the pros and cons of Lupron vs. Zolodex? 4) Has anyone had experience with having high estrogen but the your doctor did not recommend Lupron or Zolodex or ovary removal and did not seem concerned about it at all?

This is my 2nd go around with breast cancer and this time I am ER/PR+ (95%). I had no hormonal therapy for the first dx (I was only given a 2% chance of recurrence so not advised to do hormonal therapy). I also have a cyst on my ovary (found on PET Scan) but haven't heard anything yet about whether that is a concern or not. My MO gave me the option of 2 medications to choose from: Tamoxifen or Arimidex (may need to have Zoladex with it?). I also asked if an Oophorectomy was an option and was told yes but nothing was really talked about with that. Besides going over very basic side effects, that was all I was given to go on. I have to go back in about 7 weeks (after rads) with my answer as to what I want to do. I've read through different threads and I'm scared, confused, and overwhelmed.

When I look at the side effects of the Oophorectomy and Armidex/Zoladex, I worry that I would be doing more harm than good to my body due to suddenly stopping the estrogen. Also, I read that taking a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor can reduce the effectiveness of Tamoxifen. I get chronic migraines (3 to 4/week) and I'm on Amitriptyline (SSRI) as prevention for the migraines and it works great. I'm afraid to change it due to Tamoxifen.

I posted this under a LCIS topic but didn't get much response. I had an excision biopsy for ALH and just came back from my post-op appt. with a diagnoses of LCIS. The treatment recommended by the surgeon was Aromasin for five years. But looking through the discussion forums it appears most people have it as a follow up to tamoxifen. I did see this on the breastcancer.org website: \"Research published in 2011 showed that Aromasin can lower risk in high-risk, postmenopausal women who've never been diagnosed with breast cancer. Aromasin is not approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for this use, but doctors may consider it a good alternative to tamoxifen or Evista.\" So, I wonder why Aromasin as opposed to another, and would it be worth it to get a second opinion? I know the side effects are nothing compared to bc, so I don't mean to be wimpy. But I came off a very toxic antibiotic for latent TB that had horrible side effects and I'm dreading starting this.

Fast forward to about 10 days ago when I started getting the worst cramps I've ever had in my life. I've always had cramps right before my period, but not this bad.

I had a lumpectomy and 6 weeks of radiation. My MO prescribed 5 years of Arimidex (anastrozole) starting in July of that year. I didn't have the greatest bones to begin with (mom and sister have osteoporosis), so I received injections of Prolia every 6 months after about a year on the AI. During the years, the Prolia injections had to be stopped for a period of 14 months, so I could have a tooth pulled and an implant done. Besides experiencing a little bone loss, I really haven't had any side effects except for low libido and some stiffness in my joints that could very well be age - related. To combat bone loss, I have been doing yoga, walking a lot and taking Vitamin K (MK 7 form) and magnesium to channel the calcium with D that I take into my bones rather than into the blood vessels of my heart or onto my teeth in the form of plaque. I stopped the Prolia injections a year ago after we changed medical insurance companies and could no longer afford the injections. My dilemma is this...I am in between medical oncologists in that my husband and I are preparing to move from one state to another. Originally, I was supposed to take the AI for 5 years which was standard protocol. My original MO came back from a conference a year ago and said maybe we should do it for 10 years. When I last saw her last November and expressed my concern about what it was doing to my bones, she said she would be happy with any amount of time I took it past 5 years. I know the Arimidex is causing bone loss, so I am very concerned about that. Of course, I don't want to get BC again either. All my mammograms have been fine since the surgery, and I am now 5 years past the surgery and radiation. I was also told that my cancer had been extremely slow-growing. Are there others of you who only took an AI for 5 years, stopped, and have been fine since? Or do any of you have any thoughts or experiences that might help me make the decision?

Turning 49 shortly. Premenopausal. Don't smoke or drink alcohol. 24 BMI. Still doing radiaton. Drs actually talked me out of double mastectomy with recon because my tumor was so small and it's low risk grade. Chief oncologist says it's up to me if I want to take tamoxifen because my tumor was so small and other details I mentioned. She said overall without tamoxifen my recurrence rate would be 8%. That's 4% for left side cancer breast, 3% for other breast and 1% for remainder of my body which gives you the number 8. If I take tamoxifen my risk is 4% total. I didnt know they added up risks this way. It makes it seem bigger. She said many of her patients elect to not take it and she wants me to be fully informed. She said if she thought I really needed it and my risk was higher she wouldn't be afraid to twist my arm into doing it if I objected. I asked her what she would do for herself if she had my situation and she said she would take it to see how bad the side effects were and if they affected her quality of life she would discontinue it. I am concerned about endrometrial cancer since my grandmother had it but she said the risk was less than 1%. I am very afraid of cataracts, endromrtrial cancer and hearing loss the most. (I have slight hearing loss already.) I also am upset about the thought ofhaving thinning hair, vaginal atrophy, older looking skin due to lack of estrogen, fat redistribution to my midsection, depression, blood clots, etc. I'm divorced and don't want to look older sooner since my goal is to get married again and we know how shallow men are to us women who aren't 25 anymore. So if I don't take it, I would be gambling with cancer. It's acary. I'm actually surprised I get to make the decision. The radiologist oncologist is letting me skip the boost because my turmor was so small and she agreed they was okay. So I already feel like I'm cheating on the treatment even though it was approved for me to do so. Another thing. In Jan I started taking vaginal estrogen cream at the prompting of my gynecologist because she thought it would stop my bladder infections. I stopped taking it after 5-6 weeks because I was so scared of getting breast cancer even though she insisted it wouldn't do that. So it's funny how my tumor grows on estrogen, huh? All the doctors are saying they don't think it's related but who knows? I only found my breast lump because I was so paranoid about the estrogen cream. So it either gave me cancer or saved me because it made me pay attention. The estrogen made my hair thin by the way. I know it will regenerate since I stopped taking it.

No spotting or bleeding in between, not even during the 2 months that I didn't get a period. My nurse practitioner seemed surprised that I am still having periods. Because I have PCOS, I managed to get a referral to a gynecologist who will be monitoring me while I am on Tamoxifen.

My gynecologist did a baseline ultrasound this month - revealed the two small fibroids that were there before breast cancer and an 8mm endometrial lining (utlrasound was performed one week after a period).

I'm SOooo wary about the side effects but also feel like I have to give tamoxifen a go because it's my ticket out of chemo due to my low-intermediate oncotype score.

And this on managing potential side effects: https://www.urmc.rochester.edu/encyclopedia/conten... I did reach out to a couple people who have been doing well on tamoxifen and what I've learned so far is: - Gradually break yourself into your dose. Give your body time to recover from all the other treatments, maybe start with half dose for several weeks and then work up to the full dose. - Take with food to avoid nausea, or at night. - Keep moving to avoid the chance for blood clots. - Clean eating seems most effective at maintaining or even losing weight while on tamoxifen, vs. other diets. - Be moderate on coffee, alcohol and spicy foods to avoid / reduce hot flashes? The spicy food part will be hard for me. Any other advice? I would love to hear your advice and thoughts based on your experience or what you've read.

My oncologist prescribed Effexor for me, but I only took that for a week or two. It gave me awful headaches and made me feel terrible. When I stopped taking Effexor, I felt a lot better so I stayed on Tamoxifen for awhile and perhaps didn't notice that it was affecting my mood. Last spring I began to notice that I was feeling very numb- not depressed exactly, but not happy about things. I remember googling it but I didn't make the connection that it may have been caused by Tamoxifen. Fast-forward to this past July when I fell and had a terrible ankle break. I had to have an ankle fusion surgery with 8 screws, a plate, etc. I was non-weight bearing for 6 weeks and I'm home with two little kids and had to cancel all of our summer vacation plans (vacation plans that were supposed to make up for last summer when I was newly diagnosed with cancer). It was awful. I was also in a new town where I didn't know anyone. I cried every day for the first two weeks. I had to go off Tamoxifen because of my high-risk for blood clots. Lo and behold, about 3 weeks after my break I actually started to feel quite happy (despite my dire situation). I began to wonder if perhaps Tamoxifen had been affecting my mood significantly. I tried to go back on it in September, but I do think it is impacting my mood. It's like I lose the ability to feel positive about things or looking forward to the future. It's hard to describe exactly. Anyway I'd like to go back on Tamoxifen, but I wonder what my other options are.

I was diagnosed with IDC in May. Double mastectomy July 21. (See my cancer details in the signature; I'm low to moderate risk for recurrence). I don't require chemotherapy or radiation. My oncologist and breast surgeon (both wonderful women) insist I take Tamoxifen, and I cannot make myself take it. The prescription sits on my kitchen counter collecting dust. There are three reasons I can't make myself take it: 1) fear of the side effects, 2) conflicting percentages about how the drug will suppress recurrence, and 3) my belief the drug doesn't offer great enough benefit (based on percentages). My oncologist told me Tamoxifen will drop my 15% chance for recurrence to 7-8%, but when I use this breast cancer treatment calculator: www.lifemath.net/cancer/breast... .., it reads that without Tam my percentage is 15.4% expected 15-year Cancer Death Rate, and if I take Tam it's 10.5%. I've read other articles where the percentages differ. A 5-7% reduction in recurrence rate doesn't seem worth the drug cost or risks FOR ME. Even if I don't get blood clots or serious side effects, I don't want the decreased libido, vaginal dryness, more ovarian cysts (I already grow polyps and cysts in my lady parts), risk of uterine cancer, hot flashes, headaches, mood swings, etc. I know of two women who say Tamoxifen doesn't give them bad side effects. I know many more women who have terrible side effects and they either go through life miserable or stop-and-start taking it. My oncologist asked me to give Tam a try. \"You can always stop it,\" she said. But as I said, I literally cannot make myself take it. It's weird -- I've never had such an aversion to taking medicine! But I'm also anxious about NOT taking it. It's a dilemma that keeps me awake at night pondering what I should do. Is there a study that shows the recurrence rate for women who've refused Tamoxifen/hormone therapy over a span of, say, 5 to 10 years? I know of one woman who refused hormone therapy with a similar breast cancer as mine, except she had a lumpectomy with radiation (I had a double mastectomy). It's been three years and she's had no recurrence. She took Tam for 6 months but her oncologist took her off due to excessive mood swings, severe headaches, cognitive problems and feeling unwell/sick daily.

He said I should see an OB/GYN and discuss about having oophorectomy since Lupron can cause osteoporosis. My OB/GYN recommended to have my ovaries removed, so I don't have to be on Lupron, but I should still continue taking Arimidex. My BRCA gene is negative. I don't know if this is the right decision. I read from these sites that some women experienced joint pain from Arimidex. So eliminating Lupron may not help me with the pain, and having ovaries removed also raise osteoporosis risk.

The latest studies I could find saw an increased risk of recurrence basically equivalent to the decreased risk of ovarian cancer. And either way, pretty tiny.

This week I went in for an annual gyn visit, and they did a transvag ultrasound and saw what looks like a fibroid, which was blocking their view of one of my ovaries. This is the first ultrasound I've had since beginning tamoxifen nearly 5 years ago. I have no symptoms from the fibroid. When I was originally diagnosed with BC, I had a CT scan that showed I had a 3cm fibroid. It is now (5yrs later) measuring nearly 8cm (on ultrasound), and I got a call from the nurse at the gyn office that said my doc wants me to go in for an MRI. I will be talking to my doctor today about this, but I wanted to ask some good questions. Any advice would be helpful. The things most on my mind are 1) Will the MRI be able to tell if this is a fibroid or something else? 2) If it's just a fibroid, will they want to remove it (and possibly the whole uterus) if I'm not having any symptoms? 3) If it's just a fibroid are there options to just watch it? I'm 46, and this spring will be 5 yrs on tamoxifen. I don't think I'm anywhere near menopause, and I don't really want a hysterectomy if it's not necessary, and I really don't want my ovaries out if it can be avoided. My doc also wants me to do an extended gene panel to see if I have any mutations that are linked with ovarian cancer - I'm BRCA1/2 negative, but I don't know anything else about my genetics. There's no ovarian cancer in the family as far as I know, but there is breast cancer (mom, but neither of her sisters), lung (dad and dad's sister - both smokers) and esophageal (mom's sister, brother and cousin -- all former light smokers - but diagnosed late in life (and still chugging along in their late 80s/90s).

I've been on AIs for 3 years, last 2 years on Arimidex. I've had the typical side effects. Getting out of bed in the morning I have joint pains; they \"iron out\" fairly quickly, but still there on and off. Feel like I'm 90 years old, especially on waking. If I stoop down, my knees often stiffen up. On my last bone density scan I was osteopenic in my right hip and near osteoporotic in my left hip. Injuries I've had in 3 years I know Femara or Arimidex caused: shoulder tendinitis, elbow bursitis, trigger thumb. They each have appeared suddenly with no known injury. All resolved, but trigger thumb. After an hour's nap today, still laying in bed, I noticed left knee discomfort, mild to moderate. It feels more like it does when I JUST wake and get out of bed, but less \"crippled\" and more like discomfort -- but it's just my left knee. When I bend the knee up and down, that knee cap has discomfort. Ultram didn't reduce the discomfort this afternoon, so I just now iced the knee and took ibuprofen. There may be some mild swelling. I've never had this in just one knee that I recall; usually bothered by floating aches and pains. I vaguely recall hitting my left leg the other day and thinking I'd get a bruise, but don't believe it was near my left knee and there's no bruising.

I'm 56 years old. Now I'm terrified it's bone mets because it's only one side. Has anyone else had one-sided knee or other joint pain enough to take a pain reliever? Again, like other \"injuries\" above, it came on suddenly, no known cause. I'm so worried, although it seems somewhat better now after ice and ibuprofen. Can anyone please help? P.S.

I'm not even sure yet if it's what I'm dealing with at this point. I woke up the night before last with some abdominal discomfort, kind of crampy feeling. I was able to go back to sleep, but it was still there in the morning and then became absolutely horrible rather quickly. The pain was all across my lower abdomen and into my legs and back. My legs both hurt and felt weak. I started to feel kind of dizzy as well, but that might have been from the pain. I went back to bed and it slowly got better over about an hour or so. Now I just feel a little bit of discomfort and occasional stronger pains. My periods stopped over a year ago during chemo. I was on Tamoxifen from September to December and have been off it since due to a number of SE's (severe leg cramps, problems with concentration and depression, constant vaginal discharge). The Tamoxifen also gave me feelings of pelvic pressure and pain at times as well as feelings like ovulation pain. I asked for a baseline US before I started it and both the GYN and MO said no - that it's not standard of care and they would assess if needed for bleeding or other symptoms. Of course, no one cared that I had \"other symptoms\" since I wasn't bleeding. I'm concerned because, while I'm thankful that the pain is greatly diminished, the amount of pain I was in yesterday was enough to have me thinking of calling an ambulance and I've never done that. I want to know the cause of this pain and I worry about ovarian cancer, too. I had genetic testing done with my BC diagnosis and it was negative, but I've had an aunt with ovarian cancer, as well as pancreatic, prostate, and lung cancers in my family. So I went to see my PCP today and am going for abdominal and pelvic US tomorrow. He gave me the options of doing nothing, doing the US, or doing a CT. Anyone have anything similar? What was the outcome or treatment? Any advice? TCHP x 6 with pCR. One year of Herceptin. DTI pre-pec surgery.

Well, to my surprise, I have had few side effects to date and can live with them: only one night sweat in two weeks; 3-4 times feeling flush in the face; some days feeling \"slow\" but that can be caused by my age (74) and insomnia, which I've had for years; minor stomach irritation.

I called Astra-Zeneca the makers of zoladex to find out what kind of \"fetal harm\" it causes as it says in the info on the website. They are supposed to send me info. My OB is also going to get ahold of them to get case studies on if this has happened to any one else and what happened.

Mollyboo's message gave me hope when I needed it most and I'm attempting to pass the favour on. I've now been off of the AI for almost 5 months and my life continues to improve. This is what I've noted so far: my brain fog is clearing. My thinking is clearer and quicker. My ability to focus has returned so I'm returning to my previous voracious reading habits. My short term memory is more reliable. my mood has lifted. It seemed stuck in neutral, with neither highs or lows. I'm able to experience joy again after 5 years of feeling that I was wrapped in a grey, prickly blanket that was insulating me from happiness. I've rediscovered enthusiasm. My sense of humour is reasserting itself. The temptation to isolate myself socially has diminished. People tell me spontaneously how happy I look. my joint pain is greatly improved, although not totally gone. My mobility isn't as compromised and I'm expecting to further improve as I work my way out of 5 years of relative inactivity. (Please don't tell me that if I'd exercised during taking the med it wouldn't have been so bad. Attempts to push myself through the pain to exercise inevitably made things worse.) My bone pain is gone without using Claritin daily. I can get out of chairs without grunting and groaning. I hope to be able to return to gardening in the spring because I can squat and kneel again. Trigger fingers are gone. I'm able to grasp with more strength. I'm able to walk over rough ground with more confidence now that my ankles and knees are more reliable. my energy levels and stamina continue to improve. my libido is back, much to my husband's surprise and delight. Not only has my desire returned with gusto, my nether parts are well lubricated and fully functional. (Sorry if this is TMI.) I reached a point where I had an aversion to being touched at all and that, thankfully, has disappeared. my hair has returned to its previous condition, thick and healthy. My scalp is no longer visible and my hair is no longer dry and straw-like in texture. my body temperature has re-regulated. I'm back to wearing a coat in cold weather rather than sandals and a tee shirt. I can cuddle up next to my husband without the threat of incinerating both of us. my eyes are less dry and my blepharitis has improved. my mouth is less dry. My gums are considerably healthier with no change in dental hygiene habits. The mobility that had developed in my back molars has disappeared. I'm not as bloated and my peripheral edema is much improved, at least in my ankles and feet. Unfortunately bilateral arm and truncal lymphedma, unrelated to AI use, will be a permanent legacy of BC. my blood pressure, which shot up within a few weeks of starting Anastrazole, is now having to be re-regulated with medication changes. It's a work in progress. constipation, not a problem prior to AI use, has not improved. my weight, an issue prior to AI use, remains, though I feel that I now have the emotional and physical wherewithal to tackle it. Since I had neither chemotherapy or radiation, just (just!) a BMX, I put my head down and stoically lasted the course. As a footnote I'd like to say that these SE's are real and are much more frequent than many in the medical community care to admit (my MO for instance). My SE's came with AI usage and most are leaving with its discontinuation. I'd like to say to the cheerleaders who downplay possible side effects in their enthusiasm to encourage compliance with AI therapy - please stop blaming the messengers. It's not helpful. Those who are struggling to stay on the medication, or have made the extremely difficult decision to discontinue it, are deserving of validation and support, not the implied message that it's all in their heads or that they're just not trying hard enough. Education about possible side effects and their management should be the least we can expect from our medical practitioners but, all too often, it's ignored.\" kathy", "Details": "Dx 7/15/2011, IDC, 2cm, Stage IIA, Grade 3, 0/4 nodes, ER+/PR+, HER2-"},

I have had 4 rounds of A/C and 12 rounds of Taxol, a double mastectomy. The chemo got rid of all of the cancer except for a tiny spot that was removed during surgery. Clear margins, clear lymph nodes. I did have a fast growing aggressive cancer. It was stage 1A when removed. The tumor was 2.5 cm. before treatment. My estrogen receptors was 30% at the first biopsy and progesterone was 5%. HER-2 negative. After surgery my estrogen and progesterone was 0%. I don't know how that works.... My MO still wants me to take Tamoxifen to see how I get along with it. He is concerned that the chemo didn't kill every tiny bit so there might be some still around somewhere else. I would refuse it if it weren't for the aggressive fast growing part of my cancer. I guess I will always have a fear of a little seed floating around ready to start growing again. I remember reading someone saying cancer was like a dandelion that has turned fluffy and white and when you blow it it goes everywhere. I still struggle with taking this long term. I have been on it since last Wednesday but wonder at my choice. My hair is just now coming in, my feet from neuropathy are finally getting a little better. I am 68 and never had kids and still have all my lady things except boobs. I am about as afraid of the side affects of tamoxifen as I am cancer.

{"Title": "Tamoxifen is the Devil himslef", "Post-Data": "Posted on: Jan 8, 2018 03:49PM CSA", "Post": "First let me clarify that I am a male, but I sure could use some advice on how to deal with the side effects of Tamoxifen. My primary issues are severe insomnia, severe anxiety and nearly debilitating fatigue. I was fine until I started taking this horrible drug. My DX was IDC stage 2b with 3/20 nodes. Left mastectomy. Had chemo (AC and Taxol) and 30 rads. The Tamoxifen is worse than those two combined, even considering the toxic reaction I had to Taxol that put me in the hospital! I take in the early evening now, though I started out taking it in the mornings. Going into my 4th month on it. Besides Tamoxifen, I also take Lexapro 20mg in the morning, Coreg because the chemo messed with my heart rhythm, D3, CoQ10 and B complex. Insomnia - I can go to sleep, but can't stay asleep more than 3-4 hours. Then I wake up with heavy anxiety attacks and can't go back to sleep. I've tried melatonin which helps me go to sleep, but doesn't keep me asleep. I've tried Xanax .5 which will get me about 6 hours, but we all know the issues with benzos and they won't prescribe anymore anyway. Benadryl is out obviously. I'm taking all the sleep hygiene steps that I can such as turning off the TV early, keeping the room dark, using a white noise machine, not eating close to bedtime, etc. but none of this has made any difference. I had a sleep study that showed I'm very borderline on apnea, so they gave me c-pap which only inflamed my sinus to the point of bleeding. No more c-pap for me. Is there ANYTHING I can do to sleep? If I lose my job, I lose my home and insurance. My oncologist told me to see a psychiatrist, but can't get in for several weeks and even then I feel like they will only be shooting in the dark. My plan right now is to ask for Elavil in the hopes that it will help with both sleep and anxiety. I say this because I tried one of my wife's and it was the first time since taking Tamoxifen that I slept a full 8 hours. But I'm about to the point where I'm going to collapse physically if this continues. It sucks to think I can beat cancer but kill over from a heart attack due to the preventative treatment. Anxiety - I have always suffered with some anxiety, but took Zoloft for many years and it worked wonderfully for me. But when I started Tamoxifen, I learned what world-class anxiety was about! Of course I can't take Zoloft with the Tamox, so they gave me Effexor. Holy moly did that stuff mess me up! My hair felt like it was going to shoot out of my head and my brain with it. No way could I take that med. So they gave me Lexapro, which has helped maybe 25-30% with the anxiety, but it never goes away. The first four weeks on Lexapro were among the worst of my life. As for the anxiety, mornings are the worst! I start having panic attacks as soon as I wake up (in the middle of the night) and the are with me on and off all day. The anxiety never lets up. Besides mornings, the other really bad time is mid afternoon. Right about now. I just don't know how I can keep this up. And of course one of the side effects of Lexapro is insomnia too. A nice bonus. Fatigue - This is the worst! I know many of you ladies are in the same boat, but I am beyond tired. I'd have to feel better just to feel like crap. It literally takes every ounce of strength I have to make it through 8 hours at a desk. That is not an overstatement. I never realized a human body could be so tired and still remain animated. I cannot rest it away. I do try to get some moderate exercise such as walking and using the elliptical, but can tell no difference on the fatigue. I've improved my diet with more fresh fruits and vegetables, better protein, cut out as much sugar as possible, no caffeine whatsoever and still nothing. When I get home, it's basically collapse into a chair until bedtime and repeat the routine the next day while praying for the weekend. The only things keeping me going are my faith, wife and daughter. But I know my body cannot keep this up much longer. I expect many of you will answer that I have to make a choice between quality of life and the drug. And I can appreciate that, but if I quit taking the drug, will my life insurance pay should I have a recurrence in the future? I don't think I could live with myself if I quit and had a recurrence because I would feel like I didn't do enough, but at the same time I can't live like this. It's maddening. Like many of you I'm sure, it's hard to believe this is the best medical science can come up with for treatment after untold billions have been spent. Don't get me wrong, I'm thankful there is any option at all, but I'm so miserable I don't know how I'll get through 9 years and 8 months of this. There are far fewer choices of meds for males when it comes to hormonal therapy. My oncologist chalks it all up to after effects of chemo and radiation and that may be true to a degree, but like I said before, I was doing very well until the Tamoxifen. Honestly, I think they are frustrated with me because I keep asking for help with this and I don't think they have any real answers so they are pawning me off to a psychiatrist. It seems the fatigue, insomnia and anxiety all feed each other and if I could just break one of them it would get better. I'm 49 but feel 89. I guess I really don't expect anyone to have an answer, but it sure feels good to vent.", "Details": ""},

Her estradiol levels were not checked before she started the treatment but was checked after being on the medication for two months. She did experience some visible signs of her cancerous breast shrinking to be much more symmetric with her unaffected breast. She did have some light periods during this time as well as hot flashes. When he estradiol levels were checked at the end of two months (and she was very regular with all med and injections) she has 75 pg/mL. According to the chart I read, post menopausal women should be less than 10 pg/mL and pre can be 15 - 350 pg/mL. Unfortunately the MRI show some mixed results as she a very nebulous / field effect type breast cancer so some slices looked better but overall size was the same. Then her Ki67 number remained around the same at about 25%. So the doc said it not working, but we feel like it was doing something. We think maybe it did not work enough because her estrogen levels were that of a normal premenopausal woman (but I am sure they were lower that what normally she would have if not on the hormone treatment). Are there any options to enhance the estrogen suppression? The doctor can't explain why her estrogen levels are not in the post menopausal range.", "Details": ""},

My onc does not know about my alternative therapies.

Does anyone know if either or both of these drugs can kill the cancer and reverse the diagnosis? I got scanned somewhere other than my normal hospital for my last scan and the doctor could not believe that I had ever had the diagnosis I had. Though she could see dead tumors in bones, liver and lymph, she was very confused given diagnosis, the short time since staring treatment as well as the kind of treatment so that led me to wonder whether this is an atypical response.

At that time, I had a large (6.5cm), simple cyst on the left ovary, a couple minor peripheral cysts on the right ovary, and normal looking uterus. Since I didn't have any symptoms caused by the cyst, we decided to recheck an ultrasound in 2 months and then decide what to do. Now, we're 2 months later and I had the ultrasound earlier this week. The results of this US were much different. The cyst on the left ovary is still there with no real change so we know that will have to be removed. The lining of the uterus has gone from 4mm to 20mm and now has \"cystic spaces\" and there is a 4.8 cm cyst within the right ovary that has a septation (wall in the middle). Now I will have to have an endometrial biopsy on the 30th and at that time, we'll \"discuss our options.\" I feel confident that the changes are due to Tamoxifen but wonder if anyone else has seen this level of complication after less than 3 months of Tamoxifen. I would think she will recommend a hysterectomy but don't know if she would rather treat the problems and recommended stopping Tamoxifen. Has anyone else had similar complications so soon? On top of this, I had my 1st followup mammogram the same day of the ultrasound. There was a new cluster of microcalcifications right beside the area that was removed back in March. My margins were clear after the 2nd surgery and I did 30 treatments of radiation. This could be from tissue destroyed during radiation but we don't know for sure.

A week later they did \"schlerosing\". They mixed alcohol with a detergent and fill the catheter with it - let it sit 10 minutes and smoosh it around (manually like a deep tissue massage) then flushed it with saline and removed that. I was sent home. This procedure intent is to create inflammation in the area, dry up the fluid and trick your body into making scar tissue to close up the area where the fluid pooled up.

I had my diagnosis in March, stage 1 grade 3 tumour,no lymph node involvement . Lumpectomy, radiotherapy and tamoxifen were the treatment plan. I have followed that plan until three weeks ago, when after 6 weeks on tamoxifen I could no longer cope with the side effects. I have never felt so ill, (I was pre-menopausal before at 47 years old) and had some side effects from tamoxifen not even listed on the drug information. The only thing I didn't have was hot flushes (Im on venlafaxine), but after 6 weeks I have extreme exhaustion, anxiety where I couldnt function with raised BP and heart rate constantly, mood swings became crying all day, then depression and suicidal thoughts were constant at the end of six weeks. I had muscles twitching all over my body, muscle spasms, vibrations of muscles and feeling phsyically fatigued,hair loss, urinary incontinence starting, debilitating IBS with terrible bloating, weight loss, not sleeping, a period that was flooding for days, no desire to see anyone or leave the house, and just feeling like I had lost my whole 'self'. It was a desperate situation and so, I stopped taking it. I could no longer live like that. I had a postnatal hormonal psychosis after giving birth 18 years ago, so probably not suprising this happened. I took it for as long as I could, but no longer felt 'safe' with myself. I am clearly not one of those lucky ones who have little or no side effects. Anyway, that was three weeks ago. After 5 days of not taking it my mood lifted from the 'out of control' suicidal thoughts and I started to feel so much better although still having mood swings. However, after three weeks I thought that all the symptoms might have gone, many have but not all. I still have IBS and still have twitching muscles and vibrating muscles (that can be seen on the skin surface, but some are deeper and not seen and only felt). I am meant to be restarting the darned stuff on a 10 mg dose every other day for a while, and being monitored, to see if a slower 'lead in' works better. I just cant bring myself to take it until I am more stable and can be sure that the side effects will go. Is there anybody else out there who has had similar side effects to me? I am presuming I am now in a state of some sort of hormonal imbalance and it won't sort out that quickly, but I am really scared that the mental state could return to being bad and just generally terrified to be honest. I wasnt like this through the surgery and radiotherapy, I smiled my way through it...but this is/was hell on earth. Is there anybody who can relate to me and offer their thoughts? how long should I expect for all side effects to resolve? Or has the shifting in hormones pushed me into menopause now?

Celecoxib dangers were overstated Turns out that not only were there far fewer gastrointestinal incidents with celecoxib, celecoxib users suffered fewer cardiovascular events than conventional NSAID users. COX-2 inhibitors, primarily Celebrex (but also Bextra & Vioxx), were hailed when introduced as being easier on the gut than conventional NSAIDs and as effective for treating inflammation, osteoarthritis and dysmenorrhea. But a few years later, some studies pointed to a higher incidence of cardiac events among users of Vioxx, so it was pulled off the market along with Bextra. Celebrex remained available, but less widely prescribed—a last resort non-opioid painkiller for those in danger of GI bleeds from conventional NSAIDs. When I had my first knee replacement surgery in 2012 and mentioned I had GERD, my peri-op physician told me that as soon as the first adverse news about Vioxx came out, she bought 2000 of them to hoard in advance of its becoming unavailable. She suggested I ask for Celebrex. I filed it away for future reference, but in 2013 when I developed a “gastric erosive lesion of probable chemical origin,\" and my GERD became worse, the GI doc told me I could never again take an Aleve or an Advil, unless I wanted a full-blown ulcer & even erosive esophagitis (which can be precancerous). He suggested that after my upcoming second knee replacement, once weaned off opioids & gabapentin I strongly consider asking for celecoxib. I didn't at first, but after I tore the head of my gastrocnemius muscle while hiking in the Rockies, my orthopod prescribed it. Worked like a charm, and didn't affect my gut.

I was dx 8 years ago, ER+/PR+/HER- with a single positive node. I had a BMX, did 6*TAC chemo and 5 years of letrozole, which I completed 3 years ago. At the time I stopped the AI, there was nothing either way to show benefits of staying on an AI beyond 5 years for my particular dx, so I stopped after 5. As we probably all know, now there have been some study results. There is also genomic testing available, some available for node positive patients for the first time. At my annual MO appointment this month, we of course discussed all of this. My MO suggested that she could order the BCI test for me to help decide. My results just came back with a score of 8.8 (out of 10) meaning I have a high risk for distant recurrence in years 5-10. The test also shows that the probabilities are that I would get a benefit from taking an AI. Basically, according to the BCI info, taking an AI reduces my risk of recurrence from 27% to 10.5% in years 5-10. That's a substantial reduction. My MO is now recommending that I resume AIs. My problem: 1. I'm already into year 8 with no evidence of disease. Had I has these BCI results 3 years ago, I probably would have stayed on the AI this entire time. But I've been off it now for 3 wonderful years. Now that I'm already into year 8, do I still have a 27% risk or is it less since I've made it into year 8 already? 2. I had every s/e in the book on AIs. My QOL was severely diminished while on AIs, and I was never so happy as when my 5 years was up. Most of the s/e are gone by now - my DEXA is back to normal, my lipids are back to normal, my retinal issues are back to normal, and my QOL is so much better now that I'm not tired, cranky, and in joint and muscle pain every minute of every day. The thought of resuming AIs and going through two more years of sheer hell is depressing. But the thought of recurring is even more depressing. 3. There still seems to be some question about the validity of the BCI test, and ASCO apparently still doesn't recommend using it to guide treatment decisions for node-positive cases. In the end I'm probably going to concur with my MO's recommendation and start taking an AI again. But this is a savvy group here, and I'd love to hear thoughts from others.

I was reading on http://www.breastcancerchoices.org/iodine how iodine can produce the same reduction of estrogen as these medications (Femara, Arimidex, etc.), but without the weight gain, aches and pain, etc. I am one of those people who will most likely take Femara indefinitely because the cancer had traveled to my ovaries, and there is a possibility that there may be dormant cells that could be a problem if I discontinue the Femara.

I was diagnosed at 42 with a 6mm, grade 1, oncotype 5 ER/PR+ HR- cancer. I've been on Tamoxifen for nearly 3 years now and I'm pretty miserable. I've gained about 15 pounds (and I'm a small person, so this has meant a lot of buying new clothes as nothing fits any more). I have hot flashes, bad sleep, total lack of sex drive, hair falling out, dryness everywhere you can think of, plus a bunch of other vaginal issues. I'm achy and foggy-brained, too (whether this is the lack of sleep or the drug, who knows??). All of these symptoms have increased dramatically in the last 6-8 months to the point where there's never a time I'm not experiencing at least 3 or 4 of them. Right now the plan is for me to be on Tamoxifen for 10 years. I honestly can't fathom another 7 years of this. I also wonder if, given the nature of my particular cancer, this isn't overtreatment. I am at such low risk of recurrence to begin with, and when I look at cancer math it tells me that the Tamox is adding a whopping 90 days to my life span. Unfortunately I don't have a good relationship with my oncologist in the sense that she's not interested in discussing things.

To add to this, my surgeon told me she was surprised anyone was recommending 10 years for my particular case, given the details. So now I keep wondering whether I'm miserable to no good end. Has anyone discussed a break with their doctor. I'm tempted (and I am SO not this person) to just quit for a few months without telling her. But then it terrifies me. I'd love to hear your stories about this. Thanks.", "Details": ""},

I still have 2 years to go but of course, they are recommending the 10. Hey, 50-60% reduction of recurrence is great for 5 years, but 3-4% for the next 5, no thanks. I have the brain fuzziness, memory problems. I've had the joint issues and hot flashes especially at the beginning but now mostly worst around my period. Period was fine at the beginning but in the past year has changed to around 2-3 days with the first 24 hours being like a slaughter house apocalypse. I have to pour out my 2 oz Diva cup practically every hour, I wear pads and I still bleed through. At least after that, it's super light. So I'm really looking forwards to stopping it for the memory stuff and the bleeding (my sheets, my seats, my underwear, my everything, are very much looking forwards to it too). However, since I started taking it, I have lost almost 30 pounds. Now this could be because after rads, when I couldn't gain or lose weight, I started the Tamoxifen but I was also allowed to lose weight again. I take a Russian combat martial art and this may have helped a bit too. But mostly, I just don't eat all that much. Dunno if this is just me and my old habits or the Tamoxifen suppresses appetite or whatever, but that's mostly, probably why I lost weight. So, for the folks that experienced weight loss on the medication, did you note a big weight gain back when you stopped taking it? (I know this is kind of opposite from a lot of ladies' experiences) Also, what, if any, other symptoms did you experience when you stopped taking it? My oncologist said my memory issues may (or may not) be permanent, so just wondering what other people have experienced.

At first I noticed the expected joint pain, but that has largely gone away, and I thought it would be smooth sailing from there on. What has appeared, though, are significant mood problems that have felt this week like what used to be called a nervous breakdown: I am having intense anxiety, crying jags, shivering, and emotional volatility. A few days ago it got so bad that I didn't want my husband to leave me alone and I actually thought I might need to go to ER. While I know a lot of us experience understandable anxiety and depression on this journey, what's happening for me now goes beyond that. I have never had anything like this before. I saw a psychiatrist this morning, and talked to my trusted pharmacist, who both said that this drug -- and generally the body's estrogen being taken down so low -- could be causing or contributing to the problem. Pharmacist left message for my onc this a.m., but she hasn't called back. I think I'll take it upon myself to just stop taking the anastrozole: At my six-month check-in last week with onc, she reminded me that my BC was so tiny and early stage and non-aggressive that my recurrrence risk is very low, and that the absolute benefit of the drug for me is small (for example, reducing recurrence risk from 8 percent to 5 percent, etc.). Would it hurt to stop the drug for a month, see how I feel, and if necessary switch to Tamoxifen? This week I felt barely able to function normally. All insight welcome.

I'm premenopaused again. Meanwhile, all of the sudden a big 6 cm septated vascular cyst came from nowhere in just a month..they want to do surgery to be sure about what that is, but they (gyn onc.) says I should opt for oophorectomy+hysterectomy no matter what, but my breast onc. is firmly against that. They send me to MRI (with contrast), results came today, MRI says it's just a pure cyst and to just keep it watched with US...but what if they are wrong? My gyn also says they can not say for sure what it is before opening it...they may not do oophorectomy+hysterectomy if I don't want to..I just don't know what i want now.. I also may have a little dermoid cyst, two years old (they are not sure what it is, it may just be scar tissue from a previous ovarian surgery for removing a dermoid cyst). I also have lot of fibroids (some with 3 cm), I have them for some years, but they are slowing growing up, now I'm also starting to freak out about uterine cancer, what if it's uterine sarcoma and not fibroids? Or maybe I'm just getting crazy... I have read about cysts and Tamoxifen in premenopaused woman here: http://jjco.oxfordjournals.org/content/35/10/607.full ) maybe the indirect/direct effect of Tamoxifen not being opposed by Zoladex/Lupron at ovarian level is causing this. Maybe my body went crazy when I stopped the shots. I don't have anymore any kind of side effects with just Tamoxifen, before, when I has also taking the Lupron/Zoladex shots I had bad mood, bone pain, hot flashes, depression, vaginal dryness, it was doable, because I knew it wouldn't last forever. My BRCA1/2 is neg. but I have familial high risk for breast-ovarian cancer. Although I don't have any case of cancer in my direct family (besides me), and no ovarian cancer anywhere in my family, but I have uncles and aunts, and cousins with other types of cancer, like breast cancer, endometrium cancer, melanoma, kidney cancer, and colon cancer. I also had leukemia after breast cancer. I would prefer to do a oophorectomy+hysterectomy something like 5-7 years from now (I have 38 y), or after Tamoxifen ending (I will take it all out if I do Tamoxifen for 10 years, that's for sure)...but if I get ovarian/uterine cancer before that, I will be very mad with myself.. I just can't make a decision. I'm very afraid of ovarian/uterine cancer, but I don't have kids yet (but that's not my main concern), and it really scares me the oophorectomy side effects, specially long term, and I'm still very far away from natural menopause. Just can't make my mind.. I'm also scare of doing a surgery like oophorectomy+hysterectomy now, and if I decide to do it, I think that doing it with laparoscopy may be a bad idea if there's any cancer suspicion (I read that's more easy to spread cancer cells that way), I also have to take some chemo pills because of leukemia, at least for another year, and I'm afraid of getting an infection or heavy bleeding at the surgery, there are risks..even with a small surgery. Besides that, I will have to change from Tamoxifen to Femara (or something like that) after oophorectomy, and those have a lot more side effects, I already have some bone pain...and a part of me just wants to forget all this and go on with my life, I just have had enough...just not sure if ovarian or uterine cancer doesn't worry me more and don't want to look back and feel bad about this. If Tamoxifen keeps inducing this cysts and causing 2 weeks of pelvic pain before period that's not good also, I may have to switch it to Femare and go for oophorectomy+hysterectomy anyway, no Zoladex/Lupron option, I don't want to take those shots anymore.

{"Title": "Anyone else a carrier of X-linked Ichthyosis?", "Post-Data": "Posted on: Mar 18, 2016 05:00PM grandma3X", "Post": "X-linked ichthyosis is a genetic disorder. It's a mutation or (more likely) a deletion of the gene for steroid sulfatase (STS). This gene is present on the X-chromosome so may be passed from the mother to her children. Boys who inherit this gene usually have very dry scaly skin, while girls typically have no symptoms, since they have the normal gene on their other X-chromosome to compensate for the defective one. However, women who are carriers of the gene do have reduced STS activity - anywhere from 70-98% less STS activity than women who don't carry this gene. Why is this interesting? Because STS is involved in production of estrogen and there has been an interest in developing dual inhibitors that inhibit both aromatase and STS. I'm curious if there has ever been a study of ER+ breast cancer in patients who are carriers of X-linked ichthyosis. It seems to me that X-linked ichthyosis may confer added protection to women who are on aromatase inhibitors. If you are a carrier of X-linked ichthyosis and are on AI, or if you know of any studies on the relationship between X-linked ichthyosis and ER+ breast cancer, I'd love it if you would post a comment here.

My tumor was 7 cm. Ki67 is 50. I have a small lung nodule which may or may not be mets. If it disappears after I'm done with chemo, I could be stage IV. No way to test it cuz it's so small so the best I could be in certainty is a could as it could have been something else. I'll know the CT scan result in March after chemo and before 6 weeks of rads next on tap. 1) Tamoxifen for 10 years. 2) Oophorectomy- Need more info on this please. Not sure if the sx would make a big difference at my age since I am closing in on menopause. I thought this would save me from popping pills but I found out in another thread that it's not the case. So what's the point at my age? Just that it decreases estrogen production while I have it even more? Is there a time when you never produce estrogen or do you in some small amounts until you die? Does insurance even pay for this or is it elective since you can just do the pills? 3) Some sort of shot + AI - I hadn't heard of this until yesterday. I guess this came out last year so it's relatively still new. I assume you administer the shot yourself or can you have your doc do it? I hate shots, needles really so I assume this would be monthly for 10 years as well. I have a port but shots aren't administered in it I'm guessing? How on earth do you figure this stuff out? Thanks much in advance! :) Dx'd at 50. Doing it all, all by myself. Stopped Letrozole after 5 weeks. Debilitating se's.

I am shedding more than my dog and am now developing severe thin areas along my part line on the top of my head. I am taking Biotin and using Nioxin which I started in July but feel are not helping at all. I went thru chemo so I know what it is like to not have any hair. I can't bear this again....;-( My hair grew back beautifully after chemo but now I feel that I am heading towards a situation where eventually a wig or a scarf may be my only solution. Does anyone have any experience with switching to another AI---will the hair loss stop or at least slow down? Or I am pretty much doomed to hair loss no matter which AI I am taking? Does anyone have any advice? Does Minoxidil work? Is it safe? As you can tell, I am extremely upset and just don't know what to do.

Some drug usually used for seizures but they find works for hot flashes, an antidepressent (I think it's Effexor or something like that) or she said some swear that vit E helps. So not really being one for drugs, I said I would try the vit E. Well, it's not working. I also have had a rough summer due to knee surgery and it's been a really long recovery.

I recently spoke with an old family friend that I'd not seen or heard from in years. Actually, she was a friend of my mother's and after Mom passed away we lost touch. Anyhow, she told me her own mother had been diagnosed w BC about 2 years ago, she'd found a lump in her breast, confirmed to be ER+ by needle biopsy, imaging showed a 3+ cm tumor and several nodes looked to be positive. This friend and her brother, along with their mother, interviewed 3 oncologists about recommended treatment plans. Two suggested the regular: surgery to remove the tumor and lymph nodes/chemo/RADS/AI therapy-throw the book at it stuff. The third said look this patient is NINETY-TWO years old, if the surgery doesn't kill her, chemo and RADS surely will. At this age full recovery from a UMX and node removal with or without RADS would be unlikely, more likely would be loss of mobility in the arm if she survived and so this doctor recommended AI therapy only due to her age and physical condition. They went with the last doctor's recommendation. Two years later her mother is 94, still well, if somewhat frail and forgetful (she is 94 now!) but more interestingly, her last imaging showed no signs of BC in the breast or nodes! I thought this very interesting for a couple of reasons. One being that 2 out of 3 oncologists consulted were so wedded to the\" standard of care\" that they were willing to throw everything at this BC despite the patient's advanced age of 92 (a co-morbidity surely-should standard of care really be applied to everyone regardless of age and other health problems?) and the other being the amazing regression she experienced w AI only treatment. Obviously, this wouldn't be the care offered to or chosen by most. We do know that surgery in the most curative of our treatments-or a least we think we know that. Not many women w BC who aren't very, very old go without surgery and there are no studies that I'm aware of that have looked at hormonal therapy as the only treatment. Still, this gave me pause.

{"Title": "Looking For Opinions About Not Taking AI Ater  BMX ", "Post-Data": "Posted on: Jan 28, 2016 10:06PM woodstock99", "Post": "Hi - Sorry for long post but conflicted. I had a BMX & SNB on 1/2/16. I had a bad mammogram late October followed by breast MRI & 4 biopsies in November that resulted in diagnoses below in final pathology. When I spoke with my BS pre-surgery in December after biopsies she told me that I would not need chemo or rads but would need to go on AI. I met with the the MO the first time a week after my BMX. IMO, she was neutral about me going in AI's after we talked and we agreed upon surveillance. I did express concerns about SE's and mentioned having fibromyalgia (although has been very mild for past 5+ years-occasional flair-not taking any meds), cervical spinal stenosis (detected from MRI when I had an acute bout with shoulder/neck pain that went away ), being watched for glaucoma, on high blood pressure, cholesterol & thyroid meds but last bone density test was ok. She told me to see her in 6 months. I will recap my diagnosis (summarizing from final path report) : Right Breast: intermediate & hugh nuclear grade, crib form, micropapilary & flat types associated with central necrosis, and involving the lobules and sclerosing adenosis. DCIS present in buckshot fashion in 4 slabs from 11:00 to 9:00; span about 4 cm area. Margins are negative. Lobular carcinoma in situ, classic type, The 4 sentinel lobes removed were all negative.

Tumor size 2 mm, Tumor site 1:00. Tumor Focality: Single focus. Histologic Grade: 1. Nottingham Score: 5, Tubular Differentiation: Score 3. Nuclear Pleomorphism: Score 1. Mitotic Rtae: Score 1. No residual invasive ductal carcinoma identified. DCIS, grade 1, 2 & mostly grade 3, cribiform, and sold types associated with central necrosis and calcifications and involving the lobules. DCIS present in buckshot fashion in 3 3 slabs from 1>00-2:00 span about 3.5 cm. Margins are negative. Extensive lobular carcinoma in situ, classic type, nuclear grade 1 and atypical lobular hyperplasia involving preexisting fibroadenoma and adenosis. Margins for invasive or in situ carcinoma: negative. All marginsL > 10mm. All 4 lymph nodes 0 metastases. Pathologic staging: pT1a N0 (sn) Comment: high grade DCIS with focal out pouching growth at the edge with inflammation noted and a feature that is suspicious for invasion, SMM and P6 immunostains were perfumed and they highlighted the presence of myoepithelial cells, There is no evidence of invasion indentified. Deeper levels are also examined. E-cadherin is negative in the LCIS. After I saw the MO, I spent a few days rethinking taking an AI particularly after reading about recurrence on this site particularly with a high rate for those with stage 0 and 1 cancers, and I decided that maybe I should try one and at least see how I did so after I had my drains out this past Monday I spoke to the MO's nurse who spoke to the MO for me. The MO conveyed that she still was not recommending an AI for me as my recurrence risk is so low. While I am happy to hear this everyone here seems to say that you really need to at least try taking an AI which I was now offering to do and I am wondering why she does not even want me to even try one. I told the BS earlier when she was taking out drains that I wanted one and she thought that was a good idea. I sent a message to nurse navigator about this and this is response I received: I talked with your MO, who said I could share the following information with you. This may help with your understanding of the risks/ benefits of the AI and where Dr. xxx was coming from in her recommendation. The issue of the aromatase inhibitors in a patient such as this is that she has fibromyalgia and already has significant musculoskeletal symptoms which are very chronic and are very likely to be exacerbated by the presence of an AI. Since the outcomes of patients with this minute and invasive lesion are extremely good, meaning that the risk for relapse over a 10-year period is less than 5%, particularly if the patient is ER positive, it makes it very difficult to offer an aromatase inhibitor to the patient because the risk/benefit ratio is relatively trivial, even if a hormonal adjuvant reduces risk by 50% for either invasive or in situ lesions. The patient has no breast tissue. The chance of a relapse is also very small, so even if the risk was 5% with no treatment, it would only go down to about 2.5% by taking a medication for 5 years with great concern for the long-term effect of the medication on both bone density and symptomatic musculoskeletal pain. The patient asked many questions about how surveillance is done, and in particular it is not done by multiple PET scans on a regular basis, since we now recognize the effect of the radiation that comes from even diagnostic radiology. The followup is clinical. The history of this patient is also very important because she is Ashkenazi Jewish. She will not test for one of the founder mutations, and as a result she is optimally risk reduced for the breast cancer. The issue that remains is that of ovaries and tubes and the risk of potentially late onset ovarian carcinoma. This patient should have a pelvic ultrasound to be certain that there is no evidence of pathology at this time in the patient and also to set the baseline. The patient also can actively participate in risk reduction by doing some form of daily exercise and to begin losing weight since her BMI is 29 and she is approaching obese status. She is overweight at this time by classification and it is clear that exercise and weight reduction add to decreased risk for patients. The suggestion we made to her included acceptance of surveillance, no hormonal adjuvant, weight loss and daily exercise and this patient does need to have a pelvic ultrasound. We can perform that at any time. __________________________________ The nurse navigator added: You are correct in that hormonal/ endocrine therapy is recommended for women with ER/PR positive breast cancer; I imagine that was where Dr (breast surgeon) was coming from when she talked about AI therapy with you. The ultimate recommendation for it, however, comes from the medical oncologist ), who is the expert in the systemic treatment of breast cancer. Your breast surgeon would defer to your MO's expert opinion. I am happy to explain this with you if needed. I replied as follows: I do not recall MO recommending a pelvic ultrasound but am happy to schedule that. . Also the day I saw her was about a week after surgery and I was still heavily medicated having also taken 1/2 Xanax because I was scared of getting my drains removed so I was not in the clearest mental state when we spoke and have had some time to think about this since then. Yes I technically have fibromyalgia but I have not seen a rheumatologist for years and do not take any medication for it. Yes I was diagnosed with cervical spinal stenosis almost 2 years ago from an MRI because I woke up one day with a terrible pain in my neck and shoulder that lasted over a week so my internist sent me to have one but the doctor I saw told me to do nothing and it would probably go away and it did and that most people my age have spinal stenosis that would show up on an MRI. I had a bone density test a few years ago that was fine. Would it make sense for the MO to speak to my internist? If follow up is clinical and I am supposed to see both the MO and the BS in 6 months what will be the difference in the appointments? Would it make more sense to see one in 3 months and the other in 3 months to alternate? I know I am overweight (175 pounds & 5'5\") and to reach a normal BMI would require me to lose 35-40 pounds and I think the reality of that happening is unrealistic no matter how much I would want it to happen. It would take years if at all. Maybe I could lose 10 or even 15 pounds if I am lucky. I have tried to lose weight for years and I have not weighed 130 since I was in college. I am just being realistic. I already eat pretty healthy and for the past 6 months have cut down on sugar, dairy, beef, sweets, etc and increased veggies, fruits, fish, salads, etc. I don't drink soda. I have one drink a week if that. Anyone have any opinions about this? Do I get a 2nd opinion from another MO at another facility or should I just be happy with not having to take an AI and believe my risk is low enough that it is not with SE's & just focus on the best lifestyle mods I can make?

I was diagnosed at 42, very pre-menopausal, and have been on Tamoxifen for two years. I got my period pretty regularly for the first 8 months, then irregularly, then not at all for about 6 months. This fall, it has started again on its normal monthly schedule (I was very regular pre-cancer/Tamox). This is great in many ways because I also have a thyroid issue and the insane hormonal shifts were making it impossible to keep that medication dose correct, plus all the hair I lost is finally starting to grow back. But...I'm concerned that I'm getting a period every month again. Isn't one of the points of Tamoxifen that it stops it so as to prevent the spikes in estrogen, etc? My cancer was highly ER positive so this worries me. I mentioned to my onc at my last visit about a month ago that my cycle seems to have returned and she was very nonchalant, oh it's fine, not worth discussing. But still, I'm nervous, especially after the months of irregular periods and then none at all. It makes me feel like my body is somehow over-riding the Tamoxifen (a feeling I fully realize is based on absolutely no science whatsoever!). And my oncologist, to whom I was sent after doing surgery elsewhere (I was in a different state) has never been very engaged with anything I say to her. Is anyone in this same boat?

Secondarily I am concerned about the side effects (fatigue, depression) give that I already suffer with those. My genetic testing was negative, my initial Oncotype score on my DCIS was 15, and my Oncotype score on my IDC was 9. I am getting ready to go through radiation. I had a 2nd opinion with Dr. Lagios who stated that my distant recurrence rate after 15 years would be 3% to 4%. Tamoxifen could reduce that to 1.5% to 2%. He recommended that I receive a Mammaprint test to see how aggressive the tumor is to justify the decision to not take Tamoxifen. Not sure if I am eligible or if insurance would pay. In reviewing my medical oncologist's notes (before the Oncotype score was received) it appears that the recurrence statistics are between 3% to 5% (not sure if this is with / without Tamoxifen). It seems like such a small reduction in an already low risk percentage to warrant Tamoxfien. Do these percentages sound correct? What are other people's opinions? Thanks in advance!

Three years ago my mom was diagnosed with Triple Positive Stage 3 Invasive Ductal Carcinoma at 44 years old. After her second round of chemotherapy, her period went away and she has been in menopause ever since. For the first almost 3 years post treatment, she was on Tamoxifen however since her period did not return and her blood levels always showed very low estrogen levels, the oncologist switched her over to Exemestane (Aromasin) as of about 5 months ago. The doctor still tests her estrogen levels at every follow up appointment, and today for the first time her estrogen levels came back high. They're at 269 and the doctor said that she would like to see it below 90. The doctor is not worried however is referring her over to the gynaecologist this way she can get a pelvic ultrasound where they'll examine her ovaries and her uterine lining. My mom opted to have her ovaries removed (this is something she has wanted to do for a long time but it has not happened yet since she is also in the midst of reconstruction) but since her levels today came back high that is something she will be doing right away. I am extremely worried. Ever since she has had her cancer diagnosis I've suffered with tons of anxiety and after today's appointment I'm feeling extremely sad, down, and terrified. I am posting this because I was wondering if anyone on this site has had a similar experience and/or if this is something common. Again, her oncologist (who is excellent, thorough and whom we trust completely) is not worried but I am still feeling so scared and so down.

BTW, I am in my early 50s with a somewhat regular period, but only minimal night sweats and no real hot flashes. Ok, the real truth of my experiences: 1. The first night was the worse. Several hours later, got a stomach ache with gas. And woke up middle of night with a hot flash (never had one that extensive before). 2. Second day, I noticed some nausea and was ready to stop taking the medicine totally. But, it went away fairly quickly. Was noting that my worse symptoms started exactly 8 hours after the pill . So, if I took my pill at 2pm or thereabouts, when I was in bed--my stomach always started to churn very hard, like I was hungry or a lot of gas was breaking up. It wasn't bad, or excruciating, but slightly annoying. It happened every dayI took it and always, 8 hrs in--lasting for about 1/2 hour or so. My manufacturer was Mylan. 3. Most days I took a half pill mid afternoon, and then another little piece of pill after supper w/meals. 4. Don't be shocked. Most days I felt kind of \"good\"..... strangely good. So, don't think the pill from hell is all bad. I did read a few posts that people tolerate tamox fine, and some thought they felt better, so who knows? I noticed some hormonal after period headaches stopped. And my hormonal palpitations, seemed to quiet down as well. 5. I did not have any joint or aches, the only thing I noticed is one afternoon, my ear felt blocked, that kind of concerned me, but it went away. 6. I did have some night sweats, but nothing real concerning. Maybe some mild ones during the day. 7. The worse thing about the pill is the crappy way it tastes! I did break it up, and it is one jagged yucky tasting pill. (Couldn't they coat the thing?) The best thing, is that today's breast exam w/my surgeon, he said your breast tissue feels like it's settling down nicely--I guess meaning that my tamox was working. Also the most important thing, is that my MRI was clear and photographed well. So, while many brave women out there are taking tamox for years, I can only speak of my two weeks or so of taking it. I was very concerned about risks of stroke, joint pain, period issues, and the like. I know that if I had to take it, I would but might cut it in half. This is just my take on my short experience with it, and it wasn't that awful. So, don't worry about starting them. I nearly didn't, and it could have wrecked my test.", "Details": ""},

I had lumpectomy and Intraoperative Radiation in Feb 2013. Normal DEXA scan in March, Started hormonal therapy in April. I started with Aromasin, then Arimidex and have been on Femara since Oct 2013. I have not complained about thinning hair and hot flashes and have managed to find ways to minimize the joint and muscle pain, irritability and other SEs. I have been doing weight bearing exercise and am taking calcium and vitamin D3 supplements. I had another normal DEXA scan in May 2015 and thought I was doing well and had avoided bone loss with the AIs. In July I developed tendinitis in my left hand near my thumb. In Sept I had a fractured patella with no known cause - no fall, no accident, no injury. My knee just started hurting. Pain became more frequent and more severe and within a few days I felt a pop and severe pain when I stood up. The orthopedic surgeon said I have a small bony protrusion on my patella. Lots of people have them but he has never seen one crack before without a precipitating injury. Early Nov I developed trigger thumb in my right hand. Mid Nov the weakness and pain in my hands caused me to drop a pan of hot greasy juice from a pork roast and I fell in the kitchen, suffering a small non-displaced fracture in my left wrist. My wrist is healing well and I got a steroid injection for the trigger thumb. I have been feeling pretty well the last couple of weks. Last week I saw my PCP and told him about the fractures. He said a fall from a standing position should never cause a fracture. The fact that I broke my wrist when I fell is \"osteoporosis equivalent\", regardless of the normal DEXA scan. He has started me on Boniva. I feel like I have been kicked in the gut yet again with this disease. I am so angry that Femara has caused all these problems. I feel totally misled by the normal DEXA scan results - what a false sense of security that normal result gave me. It seems the normal result does not necessarily mean no bone loss. I want to stop the Femara but suspect that will not stop the damage it has already caused. I saw my MO the day I fell but before I knew my wrist was broken. We discussed the trigger thumb. He said stopping Femara would not reverse that and offered Tamoxifen. I refused it because I have a high personal risk of heart disease and stroke and Tamoxifen adds a 10-15% risk of blood clots, according to him. I want to throw the Femara bottle up against the wall until it shatters and then stomp every one of those nasty little pills into dust.

There is a wealth of information out there on the Hormone Therapy board. I've been spending WAY too much time perusing and trying to stay caught up on what's current, etc. but it's proving time consuming and overwhelming (plus, I often find myself reading along about some \"new\" therapy/test/etc only to later realize it was from 2008! Not to say, it's not valid, but more often than not, there is something more current to be said). Who knows where this thread will go, but the Chemo threads that were based on current months was invaluable to me so I'm hopeful this might prove useful as well. Right, wrong, or indifferent, my Onc has started me on a dosing regiment that is gradual up to the prescribed 20mg Tamoxifen … 1/4 dose (5mg) for 2wks, 1/2 dose (10mg) for 2wks, 3/4 dose (15mg) for 2wks, then the 20mg … for 5 yrs. I'm in my early 40s and premenopausal (went 4mos w/out during chemo, but it has since resumed for 1full cycle so far) so although I'm ER/PR+ and considering the recent SOFT study, we decided to try to get through 5yrs on Tamoxifen alone, then revisit. The idea of the gradual increase in dose is in hopes to lessen the \"shock\" to my body and minimize the initial SE's that many people complain about in the first month of starting Tamoxifen. I don't know if it will work and I don't know if this is standard Rx for her, but I suspect it was just to shut-me-up as I was very vocal about my concerns for SEs … and still am. I have more anxiety over taking this than I did with Chemo! Key area's of interest : natural remedies for any SEs, learning how to eliminate hormones from diet, understanding the difference in Tamox drug manufacturers & these \"fillers\" that appear to be the root cause of many SEs (who knew?!) and being able to discuss with others as we begin this part of the journey and help each other sort out all the info out there.

Now yesterday, just 3 months after stopping the femara, he has decided that it might be smarter for me to stay on it for another couple of years! What?????????

Plus I have been consistently 105 since my 20's, never fluctuating more than a pound or two.) Thryoid TSH shot up from under one to over two points (still within normal range). All of these numbers stayed pretty consistent to these through out the 5 years of femara, never going back down to my original numbers. I put up with the Joint stiffness and pain, as well as the terrible hot flashes and painful, dry sex, because I knew I had to! Now I don't know what to do!

First, I know you aren't doctors, but I don't need a doctor - I need your experience on AI's and anything else. I have quite a few medication sensitivities which cause me lots of stress when faced with trying something new. I am premenopausal, but likely in my last couple years of having a period. My oncologist prescribed Tamoxifen, which I didn't want. So we decided to try Arimidex, but I needed Lupron to shut down my ovaries and make the Ax work as it should. I was too nervous to take the Lupron. It's injected and if I react badly there's nothing to be done til it wears off. Onc suggested I try Ax first without Lupron, just to see how I felt. I had SE's within 3 hrs of my first dose. After my 2nd dose the next day I was in so much pain in my lower back (met there) that I could not get out of bed. My hands were not swollen but felt that way. They were both completely frozen! The dizziness set in and it was so bad my husband had to help me bathe, and on and off the toilet for two days. This was over a month ago and I still have stiffness in one hand I am hoping isn't permanent but am beginning to think it is :( My oncologist told me to go home and let nature take its course, and that I probably had \"a long while yet.\" I asked to try a different AI and she replied and I quote: They are all the same. I know they're similar, but these forums are filled with women who go from one to another if there are SE's or it stops working. I think she's afraid I will react the same way again. Are AI's really \"all the same\" ? Some ladies here say Femara is more gentle, but then I see that it can be just as bad for some. What is Faslodex? Is it an AI too? I know about bazedoxifene (BZA) which is a pill unavailable here, but I've read that people had less SE's on that? Faslodex is BZA if I'm not mistaken. I'm leery of injections, but do you think Faslodex could be gentler? Is there *any* AI that is known for not causing as many SE's? Hubby and I discussed me taking a lower dose in an AI - like cutting the pills in half, but, I'm pretty sure these meds are cumulative. If I am going to have bad SE's, would taking smaller doses stop them, or just delay them? It's a cruel joke of nature to give me a disease that I am unable to fight. It's like I can't take anything.

No 15.If \"yes\" to #14, what medication(s) were you on? 16.Did you have thickened endometrial lining while on Tamoxifen? Yes 17.If \"yes\" to #16, how many months into your treatment was this diagnosed? 18 months 18.If \"yes\" to #16, after stopping Tamoxifen, did your lining go back to normal size? I am not sure yet.

Did you know that Tamoxifen was originally used as a contraceptive in the early 60s? I guess the estrogen blocker thing…. Anyway, it turned out that women were conceiving right and left.

For a little while, the nausea went away, but came back. For several months I suffered with nausea/vomiting, diarrhea, lower abdominal discomfort and fever. It took 2 hospital stays and many emergency room visits for the doctors to determine I had C Diff, which is a bacteria that slowly destroys the gi tract. I fired my gi doc and got another one, who has helped me alot. After tests proved the C diff was killed, I still was sick with nausea/vomiting, so the new doc suspected the C diff had destroyed the cells that break down lactose. Hence, I'm now lactose intolerant. I've been off lactose completely and was doing much better but still got queezy alot in the morning and after lunch time. It progressively got worse to where I couldn't work full time because I'd throw up, my boss would make me go home until I got a dr's excuse that I was ok to come back. They are afraid the cdiff might return because it can be contagious and we do surgeries on patients in the office. Anyways, so this last time, its been so bad, the doc thought I had diverticulitis, but I had no diarrhea. I was off work again for over a week while testing results came back. It turned out I didn't have any active infection, Through all this, I'd mentioned a couple of times to all my doctors, (gi, internal med) if it could be tamoxifen or any of the other meds I am on. I was told not likely. But the more I thought about it, the more I started to suspect that it was the tamoxifen. I take my pill first thing every morning. After discussing this with my mom, she suggested I try taking it at bedtime, and see what happens. So today, for the first time, I did not take my tamox and I feel wonderful. No nausea whatsover, no body aches, fatigue. i have been unable to sit on the floor, difficulty climbing stairs, walking with slight limp, etc. Today I had NONE of that. I sat down cross legged on the floor with my coworkers today and we all cried tears of joy. I couldn't believe it. I didn't really realize how bad I'd been feeling until today. I'm going to take my pill at bedtime and hope for the best over the weekend. If my symptoms return, I'm going to call my Oncologist's office on monday. I'm scheduled for a scope down the throat on 2/12/10 but if it's proven it is the tamoxifen, I'll call my gi doc to cancell the procedure. I guess I want to know if anyone else has had this problem and what the solution was? Has anyone else taken tamoxifen at night, instead of the am, and has it worked to lessen the side affects? I'm worried about not being able to continue if this time switch doesn't work. The side affects were getting so bad it is interfering with my life, work, finances, mind, etc. Sorry this is so long, but I've been through the ringer with this and get frustrated that it's taken this long to come to this conclusion with none of my doctors being able to properly diagnose me. thank you, Deb Debbie", "Details": "Dx 10/1/2007, IDC, 6cm+, Stage IIIA, Grade 2, 1/3 nodes, ER+/PR+, HER2-"},

I have an appointment to see a psych-pharmacologist on 2/3 and expect the tapering off process to take several weeks at least. So starting, T in March is most likely. Do you have any knowledge about the impact of a delayed start to T? Is it a high risk to delay 4 months post treatment? I am frustrated because I ended radiation on 11/17 and had my follow up with the onc on 12/8. Only then did she inform me of the drug interaction issues. She wanted me to start T right away and she was planning on prescribing another random anti-d without discussing the transition process.

I am about to leave for a three week retreat and while I would prefer not to start T while away from home I am now worried that there will be too much of a gap after end of radiation.

I've been 'on' tamoxifen for about 20 months. When I say 'on' it is not quite true because I go on and off it regurarly. I have taken roughly half of the pills over the course of treatment that I should have. But the reason for my confession is that I keep it a secret, not only from my DH and family, but from my doctors as well. When the hot flashes and leg cramps get to be too much, I simply stop taking it for a few weeks, and I really do feel better without it. Then I feel guilty that I'm taking a chance with a recurrence and start it again for a month or two. Yesterday while my DD and I were watching a show about wedding dresses ( we love 'Say Yes to The Dress' on TLC) and she said, \"I hope you get to pick out my wedding dress with me\" I ran out and took the tamoxifen. I really believe in my heart that my cancer (smallstage 1 gr 2 ER 90%) was a fluke and although I wonder if cancer will be part of my life again, I don't think it will be bc. Maybe that's the way I justify it Everything I have read says that the effects of tamoxifen are long lasting, after it is stopped. I'm not a doctor, but I play one in my own life. And I have to say that if it was my DH doing this, and I found out, I would chop off his head. But this is my dirty little secret and I wanted to get it off my chest.

I have been trying to find information about how much tamoxifen will reduce the risk of recurrence. Are there any general percentages available saying that tamox reduces the risk by X amount? Or does it vary too much by case? About 3 years ago, I had a uterine polyp removed and was told I had complex endometrial hyperplasia, without atypia. I ended up getting a Mirena IUD, partly to reduce the hyperplasia and partly for birth control. Three months ago I was diagnosed with ILC (40% ER 2+, 100% PR 3+.)

I stopped taking tamoxifen in January. It wasn't planned. I had a stomach flu the weekend of the mlk holiday. I figured, no point in taking the tamoxifen if it's not going to stay down. The flu came and went quickly, as the stomach bugs usually do. Yet, when it was time to take the tamoxifen again, I decided to give myself one more day without it. And here I am months later, still not taking it. Around that same time I was going round and round with my thryoid levels. They were out of balance, but it didn't seem to be of concern to anyone but me. I was very frustrated at receiving no treatment for my hypothyroid condition. My frustration led to utter confusion by the time I started reading the conflicting information about iodine, how much is too much, does it or does it not alleviate hypothyroidsim, etc ad nauseum. All my life I've steered as far away from doctors and health problems as possible. Cancer is my first personal encounter with a serious health condition. I now have three years of experience with our health care system, and I have so many concerns about the quality of care we receive, I won't even go there right now. For now, all I know is the cancer appears to be gone, and 3 years later I was still feeling like crap. For all the research and knowledge devoted to this heinous disease, it seems to me that it all boils down to a crap shoot, who gets it initially, and who gets it more than once. I took tamoxifen for 2 years. My fatigue has been so bad since finishing radiation that I'm barely treading water and slowly going under financially. In January it seemed like my thyroid may be the culprit behind my fatigue, but when I couldn't get help from my mainstream doctors, I turned to the alternative crowd. Now I'm actually glad my mainstream doctors were so inattentive. I'm finally feeling like myself again for the first time in a very long time. Over the last two months, my fatigue is finally lifting and the nausea is gone. Ever since chemo, my bouts with nausea never really ceased completely. The fatigue did subside from 'bone tired' to just 'tired', but two years without relief felt like a lifetime. I began to wonder, what if it continues after the tamoxifen? I've been taking natural healing products for two months now, and the nausea stopped the very first day. I don't consider that a coincidence. Now I believe the way I take care of myself is the way for me to keep the cancer from ever getting a foothold in my body again. I don't think anyone can ever know for sure why their cancer does or doesn't return. My mom turned 80 last year, and she survived her bc with surgery and nothing else. So I'm taking my chances with better nutrition and natural healing. And if I should be so unlucky as to get bc again, at least I'll have a reprieve from feeling like crap every day. I've spent considerable time reading in this forum, learning about all the side effects the pharmaceuticals don't tell us about. I felt enlightened and angry at the same time when that realization came to me. The one thing that kept running through my head was 'why five years?' Are we going to suffer through five years of pharmaceutical hell only to find out later that two years is enough? Or one? Or none? We all make our own choices. Honestly, it seems like there's so little of me left, where would I be in three more years? This bc chick is ditching that beastly bottle o' toxin and making a break for a life more fully lived.

An excisional biopsy took care of the ADH, and I was referred to an oncologist who put me on Tamoxifen, because I was still pre-menopausal (48 years). Now, 4 1/2 years later, I have had a double mastectomy because of DCIS that was found in my right breast. When the pathology came back, not only did they find additional invasive cells in the right breast (pathology on the sentinel node is not back yet), but also another spot of DCIS in my left breast. Obviously, tamoxifen did not work in my case, which is also what the oncologist says. However, the more I read about Tamoxifen, the more I get the feeling that being a DES daughter, Tamoxifen may not have been the right treatment for me. There seem to be tests that can give an indication if Tamoxifen is the right drug to use, but no one ever tested me, I just started. I can't help wondering if I took Tamoxifen all this time thinking I was protecting myself, while in reality I was doing the opposite... Does anyone know more about this problem?

Thank you BCO! The December 12 proceedings included several presentations regarding AI's http://www.breastcancer.org/community/podcasts/sabcs-20131212 It's well worth a listen. I don't know if anyone else had the same reaction I did when the use of Anastrazole for prevention in high risk individuals was greeted with such enthusiasm. From the discussion, an absolute risk reduction of 3% (from 6% down to 3%) was found in those NOT diagnosed with cancer but deemed to be high risk. BCO's summary did a least acknowledge the side effects of AI's. The paper they summarized from minimized both the possibility and severity of side effects arising from the use of AI’s. Knowing from experience how AI’s have taken a baseball bat to my QOL, I look at the possibility of them being pressed upon high risk women without a true disclosure of the possible side effects a horrifying possibility. I persist in taking anastrazole in spite of of debilitating side effects because I HAVE cancer. Would I take it if I didn’t have cancer? Not on your life. My list: debilitating joint pain cognitive difficulties, lack of ability to focus elevated blood pressure total loss of libido depression constipation insomnia thinning hair hot flashes (temporarily) Some of these may dismissed as the normal ravages of time; however, to a one, they disappear when I’m off anastrazole and return when I resume taking it. I realize that each person has their own tolerance to risk.

I'm 34 and the thought of being on this drug for 5 or maybe 10 years scares the hell out of me!! I'm already having bad side effects so I am thinking about coming off it because at the moment it just seems like a constant reminder having the side effects and I want to move on with my life. I have an appointment in 10 days to talk about this at the hospital. I have asked how much Tamoxifen would help in my situation based on my personal results. I was told the following: Looking at the pathology report of your breast cancer, we would estimate that, if all women of your age, with your size, grade and type of breast cancer took hormone therapy such as Tamoxifen then: - at 5 years, an extra 2 out of every 100 women in your situation would be alive who would otherwise not be had they not taken Tamoxifen - at 10 years, an extra 5 out of every 100 women in your situation would be alive who would otherwise not be had they not taken Tamoxifen So after having this information I feel tamoxifen is pretty low in preventing cancer coming back in my situation. I have seen online so many women battling with bad side effects and not giving up on Tamoxifen no matter how bad it gets and i'm wondering if it's because they have been told in their situation it would help a lot more than i've been told it will help me? I'm thinking a drug with bad side effects which only helps me around 2% or 5% can hardly be worth it, especially the fact it might not even work.

This was my second opinion on the matter. Several weeks back a different med onc/hematologist combo said I should take it along with a blood thinner, but this also made me a bit nervous (ten years on a brand new blood thinner that has not been used for this purpose much, if at all) so I got a second opinion, and the doctor yesterday said she thought giving Tamoxifen and then trying to \"even out\" the risk with a blood thinner was risky, esp a blood thinner that can't be reversed. The issue here is that the benefit of Tamoxifen is pretty small for me because my cancer (thankfully) is already quite low-risk for recurrence. Tamox would add an extra 1-2% for me (and on cancermath it adds nothing to the 15 year survival rate), so the thinking is that the risks of either taking it with nothing, taking it with a blood thinner, or even doing Lupron, etc. are greater than the benefits. While I understand all the math, etc. I am still REALLY nervous that I am not taking advantage of the thing specifically designed to prevent recurrence of my kind of cancer. And yet I agree with the second opinion that 10 years on a blood thinner is worrying. I'm only 42 and she said if, for example, I was to fall and hit my head or something there could be uncontrolled bleeding. Anyone in this situation? I'm sort of lost and guess I've decided not to do Tamox, but not feeling great about it. The doc yesterday also said that usually they only recommend Tamox for tumors starting at 5mm, and mine was 6, so a single mm was the only real reason we were even having the conversation.

Am I too late or is it not possible? I am scared of taking Tamoxifen and losing out on the last few years of my youthfulness! Still in my 30's and single with no children yet. I had a low grade, small tumor with tubular features completely removed and radiation treatment to follow up on my right side. My appearance and energy really matter for work. If my Oncotype score was high then I would be more persuaded to take the Tamoxifen. Harsh to take it when the risk might be very low. It seems Tamoxifen is less effective on younger women anyhow and I am told I have a recurrence risk of about 5% over the next 5 to 15 years. The Tam would probably cut that to about 3%. Seems a small margin for such a strong medication and all the side effects I am reading about. I tend to react pretty strongly to any drug or medication I have been given in the past. Its been a tough year other than with the BC and its taken a lot to get back to 'normal' emotionally. Not sure how much I want to test my resilience further! I also have a problem with low bone density already - I am aware of how many excuses I am coming up with not to take it! I am so grateful to have been let off lightly in view of the hard challenges I read about on this site prognosis wise and treatment wise for so many women, so please forgive this if it seems I'm not taking the Cancer seriously enough. Its because I am so grateful that I want to live life to the full especially in these next years last years before peri- menopause. I err on the side of natural holistic medicine as a person and am now jogging, drinking green juice daily (!) and doing my best to feel less stressed. It seems these measures are not seen as any measurable deterrent for recurrence however with some integrative oncologists I am reading about, they are. As I am 'so young' the Dr's really assuming I will just take the Tamoxifen. They are saying youth is the biggest factor against me and recurrence. I obviously don't want to be foolish and wake up 3 years from now with recurrence. But the Tamoxifen no guarantee against this anyhow. Hence asking the Oncotype score. I imagine its an expensive test. Wondering if anyone else has used an Oncotype score to help with this decision? Many Thanks.", "Details": ""},

My gynaecologist had recommended me with a gel - Mithra Intim Vaginal Gel for vaginal dryness.

She explained it to me that she knows I'm a ER/PR+ BC patient taking Arimidex medication and she will not recommend what's not good for me. I had to double-check so my mind could believe that there's no harm in using this gel. So i googled it.. and found very few but convincing websites. There was this doctor on the website (i will provide the link) who said ''Yes, Mithra Intim is a safe vaginal moisturizer for breast cancer survivors. It has no estrogen so there is no risk of inducing a recurrence of cancer.'' My gynaecologist also made it clear to me that there's no estrogen etc. in the mentioned gel. I felt so glad that I've finally found a moisturising vaginal gel, thanks to the good doctor. I've applied it 2-3 times too, recently bought it. Till now, I don't feel any discomfort due to it. Instead I feel good down there. But the worrying thought that's overflowing in my mind is: Why do I not read about it (the Mithra Intim Gel) over here?

I am so glad to hear all of your opinions and feel much better now with my decision, especially after my cousin said to me today that I should listen to my doctor! I am 51 years old and was diagnosed with ER/PR Positive BC in March, 2012; the lump was discovered by me mid January, 2012. It was a 9mm tumor, lymph nodes good, Grade 2. IDC with DCIS surrounding the IDC. Radiation only; no chemo; Oncotype Dx Test score was 11. I had a lumpectomy late April, started radiation at the beginning of June, finished a month later and started tamoxifen on Labor Day. Five weeks later I started to experience discomfort during orgasm on my right side say where your ovary resides. My first thoughts were the tamox; then I thought maybe it was muscle related as it started to feel better during those moments, but I then aggravated it at the gym. Finally, I got an Ultrasound (US) in December which showed a 6 CM cyst on my left ovary and cystic changes of the endometrium (my uterus; 2 to 3 mm cysts are present). I then had an MRI which showed it is a hemorrhagic cyst and I read online that this type of cyst will cause abdominal pain, mostly on the right side. So I spoke with a gyno oncol and right away he thought it best to get both ovaries out to help reduce BC (that is only for pre-menopausal) and ovarian cancer and may want to consider my uterus as well to avoid the endometrial cancer which the tamox may bring on!! I thought just like a few of you on here -- how would you like to be castrated yourself Doctor? I even presented that to him and he understood. I struggled with this decision. I did not want to deal with full blown menopause from the surgery. I know how I am. I work out regularly to avoid weight gain which, for me, would cause depression. So if I were to gain weight from both ovaries being removed, I would get depressed. I already have moments of depression. I don't need ovary removal to add to it. I have to admit, the tamox isn't causing me any other issues, except the first few weeks after taking it, I did experience leg cramps a few times waking up in the morning and maybe a hot flash in a certain part of my leg, etc. But no real bad hot flashes experienced with menopause. Maybe working out helps with those type symptoms. I found out right before Christmas about the cyst and was so upset when the MRI said it may possibly be related to the tamoxifen (uterus stuff said it was expected from the tamox); the gyno oncol and my Rad Oncol both said it is most likely not from the tamox. Funny though, my BC surgeon said it may be. Thank you doc for being honest! So the US and MRI show the cyst is 99% benign and I am scheduled for a laparoscopy on February 19th, 2013. They claim that the left ovary will not be salvagable since the cyst is so big. So I am having my left ovary removed, unless something else is found and then it all comes out. I am so glad to hear a lot of you say on here about not jumping to have ovaries removed. One of the other reasons given by the doc is to avoid another surgery in the event the right ovary gives me problem. Right now, the MRI showed physiologic (normal) cysts and the gyno oncol did say from what the MRI states, this should not be why I am having the discomfort on the right side. He didn't agree with my online findings about the abdominal pain being mostly on the right side -- he said that would be for a cyst on the right ovary and I said no, it does not say which side, it just says that type of cyst will cause ab pain mostly on right side. I heard my surgeon is a very good doc, and even he suggested two times I get a 2nd opinion. Well, I feel that my Rad Oncol, BC Surgeon as well as my gyno were my 2nd, 3rd and 4th opinion and I decided to keep my right ovary. I am so glad that this blog exists on breastcancer.org!!

I just turned 40 so that's probably how it would go for me. The mo said that either choice would have pros and cons and that we could try out these ovarian suppression injections for a few months to make sure I can handle the menopause experience before surgery. Has anyone taken these injections? I'm a little nervous about how much it will effect me. If all goes well I'll have my overies removed when I have my te exchange in a few months.", "Details": "Dx 11/7/2011, IDC, <1cm, Stage IA, Grade 2, 0/5 nodes, ER+/PR+"},

It came it great after chemo, but the past year I have lost 60%. I'm beside myself. I had taken the hormone inhibitors for about 1 1/2 yrs., but then I refused them because of side effects. I didn't know they would destroy my bones and cause me to lose my hair. Doctors say it's probably due to lack of estrogen. I had estrogen receptor + BC, so I can't take estrogen. I'm realizing how much a lack of estogen has aged me. I really don't want to go bald. Are there any answers? At first, my MD said it was hypothyroidism. At first, the thyroid medicine seemed to stop the hair loss. Recently, he said the thyroid range is great, so the thyroid is not causing hairloss. So, I just recently went to an endocrinologist who seemed to be no help. He said it was the lack of estrogen and no doctor would give me that. Then he said I should have an ultra sound on the thyroid (which is in a good range) and use the name brand Synthroid. ??!!! Do these doctors just want to look like they're doing something? I don't see where the generic synthyroid causes hairloss. Besides I had the hl before synthyroid. The dermatolgist said my DHEA was too high. When the female hormone is low , the male hormone raises (DHEA) causing male pattern baldness. They put me on spirolactin 50 mg. I hope this helps. I won't know for 6 months, at which point, I'll be bald. I shouldn't complain; I'm alive. Does anyone have any advice for hair loss?", "Details": ""},

The nurse said my MO wants to switch me to Arimidex as I am now considered post menopausal. I realize that Arimidex is for postmenopausal women and I realize that for the time being, I am post-menopausal. Im just having a hard time believing that I am PERMANENTLY into menopause?? Worried that my MO is jumping the gun giving me Arimidex......she did mention that she has switched women from Tamox to Arimidex before and then they started their periods several months down the road and she switched them back to Tamoxifen?? The only reason I am concerned is because I am 44 years old. I guess it is possible to be in \"chemopause\" still, after six cycles of TC, but I just can't believe that I would already be in menopause.

My problem is that the side effects from the first shot of Lupron are really bad for me - dizziness, nausea, bone/joint pain, extreme fatigue, crazy making insomnia, terrible nightmares - along with the usual hot flashes of menopause. Has anyone else tried Lupron and not been able to handle the side effects? Does it get better after the first shot or is the same each time you get the shot? Or worse?

I had so much blood and no clotting that I could not tell if it was only vaginal bleeding. It was bright red and appeared to be rectal bleeding as well. My MO asked me to go to the ER. I told his nurse that I had to finish work first as it was only Monday morning and I was just starting my second week at a new job. When it got to the point that I was filling an overnight pad every hour, I gave in and went. The doctor there was also unable to tell where it was all coming from. She did several exams and finally determined that it was all from the cervix. She ordered an ultrasound and they were unable to find the left ovary and the right one had a large cyst. I have been on Tamoxifen since April 2011 through October or November when I switched to Arimidex. I had hormone testing several times and was determined to be menopausal at 41. Last night's blood work showed that I am now not menopausal. What I am wondering now is why my MO is ordering a PET scan and a visit to a GYN before we get together again next week to determine the next course of action? Why couldn't I have just gone back to Tamoxifen and called it a day? He said that the options would be Tamoxifen and a shot (can't remember the name) that suppresses the ovaries or getting the ovaries out. What do the women who are pre-menopausal do? I thought that they could just take Tamoxifen and do nothing else. I did ask the MO about the PET. He said that it is just an ideal time while we are in between treatments to recheck everything. I just feel suspicious of this answer because last year when he gave me one, he said that it was completely optional and all up to me. He wanted me to have the opportunity because I had had so much treatment to see that it was all successful before moving on to Tamoxifen. Now this PET, he is requesting without it being an option, but I am not sure which part of the symptoms triggered his interest in getting it done... any ideas? And, he is pushing me to get all of this this week, when he is normally not in a huge rush.

It goes from about 2cm below the areola downt o where the breast meets the chest, and is about palm sized. Depending on the day, it's slightly pinkish, and the skin in quite dry. It is also very itchy. My rad onc nurse said that it could be a delayed reaction to the radiation, and to put glaxal base cream or other types of cream like the ones I used during rad treatments. It got a bit better but never fully went away. It does feel less itchy when I first put the cream on it. I saw that a rash can be a side effect from tamoxifen, so I called my med onc nurse to see what they tought. She said that she's never heard of a reaction 7 months after radiation, or 6 months into taking tamoxifen. If it was caused by either of those it would have happened earlier... So I'm going in to see my onc in case but not until Jan 23rd. She did suggest that it could possibly be a fungal rash perhaps, but can't really know without seeing it.

(I refused to try the bar of soap for lack of any scientific evidence that it does anything!) I did some reading and found that runners experience cramping due to electrolyte imbalance resulting from dehydration. They were having good results from Emergen-C Electro Mix, which is a supplement in powdered form that you add to water to replace the electrolytes. I wondered if electrolyte depletion might be what was going on with me and figured it was worth a shot. Unlike Gatorade and other sports drinks, there is no sugar and no carbs in this. It contains potassium, magnesium and chromium and is sweetened with herbal stevia. The results were pretty much instant and very impressive. The cramps and spasms are greatly deminished. I took a packet in to my doctor to make sure it was OK if I drank this on a daily basis and my doctor gave me the OK. (Check with yours please!)

I am through menopause, but he said that if my body is still producing a lot of estrogen, I may be a candidate for Tamoxifen. I am not someone who is reluctant to take medications if they can help with a condition and I'm not someone who experiences lots of side effects with drugs. But, I am feeling reluctant to go on an estrogen blocker and before I talk to the doctor I'd like to be better informed. I am a little confused by the fact that my pathology report lists \"invasive ductal adenocarcinoma\" and DCIS, which to me sounds contradictory. My tumor was 2.3 cm and since the surgeon took a fairly wide margin during the biopsy, the margins were clean when she did the lumpectomy. So, I guess it was invasive in that it had gone beyond the original tumor, but not much. I get yearly mammograms so I believe this was caught early on. Basically, I feel that with the lumpectomy and the radiation, my chances are good that it won't come back any time soon. I will be checked with mammo or MRI every six months, so I believe they would find it if it returned. So that leaves me wondering why I should put my body through 5 years of an estrogen blocker if I don't need to. Everyone I know who has estrogen-positive BC has taken the estrogen-blocker, but I wondered if others out there have had success forgoing it.

The blood clots tended to occur following surgery, leading Cuzick to recommend that women on tamoxifen be taken off the drug and put on blood-thinning agents prior to major surgery. \" My questions: I'm a little puzzled by the data. My doctor said everyone has a 1:1000 or 0.001% risk of getting a clot in their lifetime. In this study the women on the placebo has 17:7000 or 0.0024% (so 2 1/2 times higher than what my doc quoted me, that's just for the duration of the study, 5 years vs lifetime risk).

Maybe these numbers don't matter per se but just an FYI. I bet most surgeons know this and that tamoxifen is on the list of drugs to avoid.

Before Femara was prescribed I received my DEXA scan results showing some mild osteoarthritis and slight osteopenia in one area (forget where!) After a few short trials, Femara was a disaster, creating horrific depression and immediate joint problems. I also suffered a rotator cuff injury during that time, apparently by simply lifting a light box, that took a few months or more to heal. My oncologist switched me to Arimidex, which was wonderful at first, as AI's go. I've been on Arimidex (generic) now for about 1-1/2 years.

The weather (stormy) might be making it worse, but I great trouble and hope it goes away soon. In addition to this, I have two pre-existing conditions of over 15 years' duration: chronic migraines (near daily) and seen by a top neurologist; and depression, exacerabted by Arimidex.

I am currently 25 years old so I am premenopausal, and I've experienced extremely heavy periods, too frequent periods, ovarian cysts, and menopausal symptoms such as hot flashes and night sweats just to name a few. Because of the cysts I have had transvaginal ultrasounds every six months, and my last one showed what my gyno thought to be a small area of endometriosis at the back part of my uterus. I have not had many symptoms of the endometriosis. Recently, I have been cramping and bloating consistently. It isn't painful by any means, but I'm always uncomfortable. I have been getting light headed, fatigued, and moody very easily. Just last week I bled after intercourse with my boyfriend, which has never happened to me before. I just got another ultrasound last Thursday and it seemed like they did some extra steps: listened to blood flow, made me hold my breath, and at one point she pressed the wand firmly against the back of my uterus, noting to me that I would be feeling some pressure and that she was sorry. Afterwards, I waited in the waiting room for a good 25 minutes before she said I could leave, something that's also never happened to me before. Since then I've been doing a lot of research on Tamoxifen and my side effects, and I've realized that It seems, with my symtoms, I should have been recommended for an endometrial biopsy by now. I haven't gotten my results back yet from this ultrasound, so maybe they will recommend it this time around, but I was just wondering if there was anyone else out there who would request a biopsy even if, once again, my gyno comes back with no recommendations.

I had an appointment with my onc yesterday and we discussed the problem I am having with vaginal atrophy. A couple of years ago I had this same issue along with constant UTI's (every 4 weeks!) and my onc OKed the estring. Everything was going great, I was having my estradiol levels checked periodically and they were staying low. Then all of a sudden after about a year of using this product my levels shot up to 80. So we both decided no more estring. Well that was about a year ago and up until now things \"down there\" have been tolerable, but now seems to be getting worse (more painful sex). I haven't had any UTI's for over a year so I can try other remedies for the discomfort. Because of the size/stage and nodal status of my tumor she is thinking (as am I) that I should stay on some anti hormonal for another few years. What she did suggest is that if I can tough it out through the next 6 months when I complete my five years of Femara, then perhaps she can put me on Tamoxifen and I can go back to using the estring since serum levels of estradiol would not really be much of a concern since Tamoxifen works in a different way. Anyway my question is (finally ) has anybody else ever done this type of regimen? I know I have read about being on tamoxifen for a couple of years and then switching to an AI for 5 years and the great statistics for that.

My 86 year old Mother-in-Law has right sided invasive ductive carcinoma stage 4 with bone mets. Two lymph nodes are affected and she has 3 tumors in her spine one of which caused a bone fracture in her neck. She has 10 radiation treatments to try and shrink the tumors in her spine and alleviate the pain. My real concern is related to Arimidex. The oncologist recommended we try that treatment. She said there would be no side affects except maybe a little bone loss. My husband agreed to the treatment and almost immediately she became violently ill. She started haveing nauseau, vomitting, diarrhea, joint pain, dizziness, etc. She ended up very sick, in the hospital, Kidney failure and such. It has been 10 days since the side affects started and she still can't eat because of all the vomitting she did. Looking at food gags her. We stopped the Arimidex because that was the only added drug given when all this started happening. The doctor said it is not the cause and that Arimidex has no side affects and that it is not Chemo. Another doctor said it is in the Chemo family. I read up on it and am still so confused. Everything I read said there is a chance of the above side affects plus more. A nurse told me her chances of these side affects increase because of her age. We don't know what is the right thing to do. Mom has made it clear she does NOT want chemo. Is Arimidex a form of chemo? Can anyone help me out? Please....we really want to do what is best for Mom. The doctor said she has about 6 months and we don't know if we should give the Arimidex. If it is Chemo and she is going to be violently ill, what kind of quality of life is that for her?

{"Title": "Dr Love on the CYP2D6 tamoxifen resistance test", "Post-Data": "Posted on: Aug 3, 2011 09:59AM peggy_j", "Post": "From www .dslrf.org Key conclusion: In sum, the researchers concluded that for postmenopausal patients with hormone-sensitive early breast cancer, CYP2D6 testing is not justified to determine whether to give tamoxifen. In addition, the presence or absence of hot flashes should not be used as an indicator of whether tamoxifen is effective. Should I have the CYP2D6 tamoxifen resistance test? Updated January 2011 A growing number of companies have begun offering \"direct to consumer\" genetic testing or genetic \"home testing.\" One of the tests now available is the \"tamoxifen resistance\" or \"CYP2D6\" test. This test examines a gene called 2D6, which produces the enzyme CYP2D6. This enzyme is necessary for the body to metabolize a number of drugs, including tamoxifen. Different people have different variations of this gene. Initial studies had suggested that some variations metabolize 2D6 drugs very quickly, while others don't metabolize them as well, or at all. A study presented at the 2007 San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium suggested that women who inherited a certain variation of the 2D6 gene were almost twice as likely to have their breast cancer recur, even though they were more likely to complete their tamoxifen treatment. About ten percent of the population has this variation. The study also found that women who scored zero on the gene test rarely had any side effects from tamoxifen, whereas women with the highest scores did. This finding appeared to confirm previous research that had suggested that the side effects of tamoxifen were an indicator that the drug was working, and that women who were not experiencing side effects were not getting the full benefit of the drug because their body was not metabolizing it properly. It also supported a Food and Drug Administration Clinical Pharmacology Subcommittee recommendation, made in 2006, that the tamoxifen label carry a warning that the drug may not be as effective in women who carry a version of the 2D6 gene that does not metabolize the drug. As a result of this research, between 2008 and 2010 some breast specialists began to recommend that a patient considering tamoxifen first have CYP2D6 testing. Others suggested that women who went on the drug monitor their side effects. If you were having side effects, it meant the drug was working. If you weren't, then it wasn't, and you would need to pursue other options. As more women began to be tested, researchers continued to study tamoxifen resistance. And at the San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium in December 2010, researchers presented data from two of these studies that brought into question what many doctors had come to believe about the CYP2D6 enzyme, tamoxifen and tamoxifen-resistance testing. These studies used data from two large clinical trials that had been done to compare the effectiveness and safety of tamoxifen and an aromatase inhibitor. (Aromatase inhibitors are metabolized differently than tamoxifen, and are not affected by CYP2D6). These findings showed that women who had mutations in the genes that control the enzymes that metabolize tamoxifen were NOT more likely to have a recurrence, and that the scoring system that differentiates women into poor, intermediate, and extensive metabolizers did NOT predict recurrence. The studies also showed that women on tamoxifen who used antidepressants that were thought to inhibit CYP2D6 were NOT more likely to have a recurrence. In sum, the researchers concluded that for postmenopausal patients with hormone-sensitive early breast cancer, CYP2D6 testing is not justified to determine whether to give tamoxifen. In addition, the presence or absence of hot flashes should not be used as an indicator of whether tamoxifen is effective. So, where does this leave us? Clearly, more studies need to be done. An overview of the data presented at the Symposium noted that, since 2003, 178 articles have been published on tamoxifen resistance. Fourteen of these studies showed that CYPD2D6 was associated with breast cancer recurrence in women on tamoxifen, and 15 found that it was not. This suggests that, right now, there appears to be little reason to have CYP2D6 testing, since it is now not clear what the findings of this test really mean. It also means that if you are not experiencing side effects, you should not conclude that the tamoxifen is not working. References: Rae James M. for the ATAC Group.

I didn't see a chip at the bottom of the teeth, but did see what appeared to be almost an area in the middle where a thin layer had chipped off, like part of the enamel. I'm guessing both front teeth appear to be weakening from an enamel standpoint, but only the front teeth. I don't think it was like that before, but I'm not sure.

It's hard to make appointments and keep them and I've delayed visiting the dentist. I'm so afraid what they're going to say. Would a crown even help if the tooth was weak or thin?

{"Title": "Long tern Tamoxifen increases survival", "Post-Data": "Posted on: Mar 22, 2011 07:19PM knowledgeforpower", "Post": "A recent study shows long term use of Tamoxifen both helps reduce recurrence and helps reduce heart disease in post-menopausal women. Here are two reports on the study. TUESDAY, March 22 (HealthDay News) -- Taking the breast cancer drug tamoxifen for the recommended five years protects women from breast cancer recurrence better than a two-year course of the drug and it also shields some women from cardiovascular disease, new research finds. The cancer protection and heart-disease risk reduction were noted 15 years after starting treatment, according to the study published online March 21 in the Journal of Clinical Oncology . The findings may surprise many women on the medication, said Allan Hackshaw, deputy director of Cancer Research and the University College London Cancer Trials Center. \"I think many women don't realize the benefits [reduced cancer recurrence] last a long time if they can complete the five-year course, and particularly also the CV [cardiovascular] disease benefit,\" he said. Hackshaw and his colleagues studied follow-up data for 3,449 participants in the Cancer Research UK \"Over 50s\" trial comparing tamoxifen use of five years and two years by women with early beast cancer. The women were between 50 and 81 at the start. During the initial study period, 1987 to 1997, the women took 20 milligrams of tamoxifen a day for two years. After that, they were assigned randomly to stop taking the drug or to continue taking tamoxifen for three more years, if they were recurrence-free. The researchers then tracked cancer recurrences, new tumors, death and cardiovascular events through April 2010. There were 1,103 recurrences, 755 deaths from breast cancer, 621 cardiovascular events and 236 deaths from cardiovascular events. They found that 15 years after the women first began taking tamoxifen, for every 100 who took it for five years, nearly six fewer women suffered a recurrence compared to those on the two-year regimen. The longer treatment reduced the risk of breast cancer developing in the opposite breast by 30 percent, the researchers found. The effect on heart disease among women 50 to 59 years old was even stronger -- a 35 percent reduction in cardiovascular events and a 59 percent reduction in deaths from cardiovascular problems. However, among older women the heart effect was much smaller and not statistically significant. Tamoxifen, used for 30 years to treat breast cancer, inhibits the ability of estrogen-receptor positive cancers (the majority of breast cancers) to grow by disrupting estrogen activity. It's not clear how the drug protects against heart disease, Hackshaw said. \"But there is evidence that tamoxifen reduces lipid levels [for example, cholesterol], which we know in turn reduces cardiovascular risk,\" he explained. It's possible that the protective effect declined in older women because damage to the arteries had already occurred, he speculated. The new research is a timely reminder about the benefits of tamoxifen, said Dr. Joanne Mortimer, vice chair of medical oncology at the City of Hope Comprehensive Cancer Center, Duarte, Calif., and director of its women's cancers program. Although many doctors prescribe medications known as aromatase inhibitors for breast cancer instead of tamoxifen, Mortimer said tamoxifen is still widely prescribed. \"Maybe for those who have problems with an aromatase inhibitor, they would be comforted by the fact that tamoxifen is an alternative and has a favorable effect on normal tissues, like bone and heart muscles,\" Mortimer said. While not discounting the effectiveness of aromatase inhibitors, Hackshaw said tamoxifen is much less expensive. A month's supply of 20-milligram tablets, the dose used in the Hackshaw study, is about $100. Brand-name versions of aromatase inhibitors can cost more than $500 for 30 pills, although cheaper generic versions are also available. In an editorial accompanying the study, Dr. Kathleen Pritchard, of Sunnybrook Odette Cancer Center in Toronto, said the findings about heart protection should be regarded with ''some caution,'' although the finding is of interest. Some research has found cardiovascular deaths higher in women on aromatase inhibitors than tamoxifen, she writes, although not all studies of tamoxifen have found the cardiovascular protection. So, still more research is needed, she said. Long-term tamoxifen boosts breast cancer survival URL of this page: www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ne... news item will not be available after 06/19/2011) Monday, March 21, 2011 Related MedlinePlus Page Breast Cancer LONDON (Reuters) - Breast cancer patients who take the generic drug tamoxifen for five years are less likely to see their cancer return than those who take it for only two years, according to a large long-term study by British scientists. The findings showed that for every hundred women with breast cancer who completed a full five-year course of tamoxifen, the cancer came back in around six fewer women, compared to those who only took the drug for two years. \"Women diagnosed with early stage breast cancer who are prescribed tamoxifen are recommended to take the drug for five years, but we know that many stop after two or three,\" said Allan Hackshaw of the Cancer Research UK and University College London Cancer Trials Center, who worked on the study. \"Worryingly our results suggest that by doing this, they could increase their risk of cancer coming back.\" Of the nearly 3,500 patients studied in the trial over 10 years, the cancer came back in around 40 percent of those who took tamoxifen for five years, compared to 46 percent among those who took it for two years. Breast cancer kills around 500,000 people globally every year and is diagnosed in close to 1.3 million people each year. About 75 percent of these cancers are estrogen-receptor positive, meaning they are driven by hormones. Tamoxifen was the first drug to block the effects of estrogen, and a new generation of drugs known as aromatase inhibitors has now been developed to act in a similar way. Experts in the United States estimate that five years of tamoxifen would cost around $8,500, compared with $50,000 to more than $200,000 for chemotherapy to treat breast cancer. The drug has side-effects. It raises the risk of blood clots, of uterine cancer and of cataracts, according to the U.S. National Cancer Institute; but most experts say its benefits in reducing breast cancer risk outweigh these rarer problems. This latest British study, which was published in the Journal of Clinical Oncology on Monday, also found that an added benefit of taking tamoxifen for five years was that it reduced the risk of developing or dying from heart disease. This effect was strongest among women aged between 50 and 59 at diagnosis, with 35 percent fewer women developing a heart condition and nearly 60 percent fewer deaths as a result, they said. Scientists know that taking tamoxifen for five years gives the best chance of survival from breast cancer. But this trial is the first large study to compare long-term benefit of five years of tamoxifen versus two, over a 10-year follow-up period. A study in the 1990s by British researchers found that giving tamoxifen to all breast cancer patients who need it, whatever their age, could save an extra 20,000 lives each year worldwide.

In a meta-analysis, Eitan Amir, M.D., of the Princess Margaret Hospital in Toronto, and colleagues evaluated data from seven large randomized clinical trials that compared tamoxifen with aromatase inhibitors in postmenopausal women with early-stage breast cancer. The investigators also evaluated whether switching from treatment with tamoxifen to aromatase inhibitors had any effect on adverse events. The investigators found a 20 percent higher probability of developing cardiovascular disease and a 48 percent higher risk of fractures associated with any duration of any aromatase inhibitor used ; aromatase inhibitor use was tied to a reduced risk for venous thrombosis and endometrial carcinoma (odds ratios, 0.53 and 0.32, respectively). The investigators also found that the risk of serious adverse events was similar among those who were initially treated with aromatase inhibitors and those who switched to aromatase inhibitors after treatment with tamoxifen. \"However, it appears from the data -- and this is strictly hypothesis-generating -- that if a woman switches from one drug to another, there is a reduction in the risk from death from causes other than breast cancer,\" Amir said in a statement. \"This potentially suggests that there may be side effects that build up the longer a woman is on a certain drug, but switching drugs may reduce the side effects.\" Knowledge is the antidote to fear, Ralph Waldo Emerson", "Details": "Dx 5/10/2008, IDC, 1cm, Stage IB, Grade 2, 0/3 nodes, ER+/PR+, HER2-"},

A few weeks ago I noticed mid upper arm achiness/soreness on the side of my lumpectomy. No signs of lymphedema and had just had a followup with my radonc with a negative rib x-ray because I had concerns over a feeling of a 'rib bruise.' At the time of that followup, I didn't have the upper arm soreness or would have mentioned it to the doctor. As I'm sitting here today typing this, I would say it's the only area in my body where I feel any discomfort and it feels mildly to moderately achy and sore. It's in the area where I had my influenza vaccine, but I had the vaccine in October and never had any sensitivity after. There is no redness or swelling. Sometimes the soreness is felt around my back and/or upper chest/rib cage area. If I run an errand or do anything other than very mild housework, I can feel very sore in my upper body, fatigued, almost like an \"old lady.\" Most concerning to me is the on-and-off, one-sided upper arm soreness I get, mostly at night. It's not pain, not shooting, not radiating, no chest discomfort, and my BP, cholesterol, etc. are all ideal. I would describe the soreness like that one feels a day or so after receiving an influenza vaccine. The soreness is annoying and definitely noticeable, but comes and goes and is most prominent while sleeping or upon waking. There have been many times it's so bad at night I have to hold the arm and roll over to the other side. I would say it feels musculoskeletal and I've never been dx'd with fibromyalgia, so don't know what that feels like. The discomfort makes it difficult to reach behind my back with the affected arm or itch my back, etc. How would you describe the type of soreness and/or pain you get with the Femara? Can it be on and off again and have you ever had musculoskeletal pain and not just joint pain?

Now that I'm back, and writing, I realize how I've missed being here. I finished my 5 years on Arimidex last November. My endocrinologist has been monitoring my thyroid, and says that over the past two years it's been wavering between normal and low. Now, it's at the point where she has given me a prescription for medication, which I had filled yesterday. She told me there are no side effects. She started out with a low dosage, and a generic. However, the insert from my pharmacy, which does indicate that radiation (which I had) can engender a low thyroid hormone level, stresses the fact that hair loss over the first few months is a real side effect. After some minimal research this morning, I'm becoming aware that it's not uncommon, that many doctors don't even know about this side effect, and that many women have lost their hair. That if dosage is too low, hair will fall out, that if it's generic and not natural, hair will fall out. Keeping my hair played a role in my bc treatment decisions. It could be a deal-breaker for me, re taking the thyroid meds. I don't think I would be able to mentally handle that. So, I did not begin the medicine this morning, and don't know what to do next. Would it be possible for anyone who knows about this situation to give me some information, or even put my mind at ease. Is this a rare side effect of taking low thyroid medication? Or, would I be mentally paralyzed, waiting for the hammer to drop every waking and sleeping hour, as to losing my hair? Any help or info or advice would be so very greatly appreciated.

From the ASCO Breast Symposium news this month.... Clinical trials forthcoming... \"We believe testosterone is beneficial to breast tissue, and, in fact, most of my referrals are from oncologists,\" Glaser told MedPage Today. \"The downside is that testosterone can be aromatized into estradiol, which may stimulate breast tissue. \"So, we came up with the combination of testosterone with an aromatase inhibitor, delivering it subcutaneously. It is extremely well tolerated, there are no compliance issues, and it takes care of the symptoms.\" Breast cancer survivors often have severe menopausal-like symptoms owing to treatment-induced hormone deficiency. Clinical and preclinical evidence suggests androgens inhibit mammary epithelial proliferation and breast growth, leading researchers to wonder if adding testosterone to hormone therapy will reduce the breast cancer risk associated with estrogen/progestin treatment. Glaser and colleagues have evaluated subcutaneous testosterone implants for treatment of hormone deficiency symptoms in pre- and postmenopausal women without breast cancer. In an article currently in press, they have reported that the implants relieve a variety of symptoms, including hot flashes, sleep disturbance, depressed mood, irritability, and fatigue. Each combination implant contains 60 mg of testosterone and 4 mg of anastrozole, and patients receive two of the implants every 90 days.\" Click here and also listen to the audio message: http://www.medpagetoday.com/MeetingCoverage/ASCOBreast/22547 Deborah DISCLAIMER!

So, I was thinking about talking to my OB/GYN about an oophrectomy so that I can stop the Lupron injections. Anyone else go this route? Are the SEs similar or not as severe? Just curious. Thanks!

The pain from Femara had built up over 9 months to where I was crying in the morning, barely able to get to the kitchen for pain meds, then just sitting, waiting the hour it took to be able to walk a little. Arimidex caused such pain that I only lasted on that one a month. I faxed a letter to my onc when I quit 5 weeks ago, asking what was the benefit. No callback. I called every day since last Thursday, no callback. Today, after getting cortisone injections for the trigger fingers, I called and got hold of him. He said my risk is very small with oncotype 7 and radiation finished a year back. But I think there was something I read about the oncotype score was valid only with adjuvant therapy - AIs and such??? He said the decision is up to me. But he more or less didn't respond when I said I was concerned about the soft lump that seems to me a little larger now but doesn't show on mammogram ultrasound. And what about the enlarged lymph nodes on the other side, one probably a fiberous cyst or something because it seems to be way up top in breast tissue. OK, this is getting confusing. I had these things before the cancer surgery but nobody seemed concerned. I'm probably going to go to a surgeon (my surgeon's hospital closed and he moved to one farther away) and see about getting the lump removed or maybe just a needle aspiration. My husband asked me if I really wanted to do all that wire location and dye, but I explained the dye is for lymph nodes. Since the lump is easily found near surface it might not need wires either. I'd go back to the Femara for another try if I thought the benefit outweighed being crippled. I feel so much better without the drugs and I'm no use to anyone while on them.

I think its because onc wanted to keep a close eye on me as I have been so unhappy on the AI's.....based on the clinical trial I was on (sure I've been kicked off now...you'll see why I say this as you read this long post), I was supposed to go to 6 month intervals at year 3. My onc visit went well....one of the better visits in quite some time. Onc had a 4th year med student with him yesterday and asked if he could participate in the appt and the exam....said yes.... My onc has always told me that I am doing well....yesterday was the first time that he added \"cancer wise\" and said that his job is to keep me cancer free. We talked about all the side effects and how unhappy I am that I am not back to where I was prior to Dx. The thing that has me the most upset, is that I can no longer do what I did before Dx...I am no longer the person I was before. This is what bothers me the most. He blames a lot of it on not enough sleep and that if I could get 8 hours (yeah get real, didn't get 8 hours before Dx) sleep then some of the problems would go away. We talked about the joint pain, insomnia, anxiety, depression, and cognitive issues.....onc was incredulous about how much meds I take to sleep...also talked about that if I push myself too much for 2 or 3 days, then I hit this brick wall...that I just can't function....he talked about how lack of sleep inpacts cognitive skills (I know that) and asked if I wanted any testing done. I told him that I did not see any purpose in a neuropsych eval as I have no prior baseline and he said that this would be the \"new\" baseline to measure against any possible \"future decline\"....and I talked about that even if things came out WNL, that would not show any changes from before all this c***!!! We kind of left it open...He also asked me if I had ever seen a sleep specialist....YES...two years ago and this past summer participated in a study called \"REST\" looking at using visualization...also talked about biofeedback and he felt that I should look into it....the sleep specialist is a friend so it will be easy to talk to him about it... It was hard to explain that its just not being tired at the end of the day, it is total exhaustion which is different. I told him that I did not think that I could work full-time anymore due to the cognitive issues and the overwhelming fatigue that hits (not just tired, but utter exhaustion) when I go over my limit (whatever that is these days)....he offered to write whatever I needed (as he has offered several times)....I told him that I left my full-time position last year and was working 2 days/week, but did not feel that I could increase to full-time..... Onc told me that the AI's provide me with a 30% benefit/increase in disease free survival....as much benefit of chemo. ...but then he went on to agree that QOL is also important. He said he was willing to give me a couple month break from the AI's....he asked when I would start and I said NOW....so with my onc's blessing, I am taking a 2 month reprieve from the Aromasin.....I see him again the middle of May (2 months) and we will see how I am doing....if I feel a lot better, then we know its from the AI's and then the question will be, what do I do....go back on AI's or take my chances.....if I don't feel better, then I will probably go back on them.....but I really want the chance to feel good and see what is from the AI's and what is just is!!!!! Onc also talked about that even though Tx has been a few years, it is still cumulative....after I left the onc appt, I felt kind of numb...wasn't sure really if I was making the right decision (remember be careful what you ask for!!!)...but today I have been in a really good mood....so till the middle of May no Aromasin....Onc did say that if I was having problems or if I wanted to go back on them to of course call him.....I have always liked my onc....but yesterday I had a new appreciation for him....he really has heard me and was willing to listen to me and know how unhappy I am....For now, I know I am making the right decision....it may be a risk, but its one that I feel that I have to take....Now just have to wait on blood work...besides the regular blood work that he does (tumor markers, CBC and complete metabolic panel he added thyroid....should have the results by the end of the week or beginning of next week........Hugs to one and all.....Karen Karen in Denver, Dx 02/03/2006, ILC, stage IIIa, ER/PR+, HER2-,", "Details": ""},

I only had heat flashes for about one month of tamoxifen. They went away and I haven't had any other symptoms. My questions are, #1 Is there anyone out there who did not have the joint pain and aches with arimidex in other words no side effects, #2 Even though I had and went through the hot flashes would I get them again on arimidex and #3 After being done the arimidex do the joint pains and aches go away and you're back to feeling normal?

Research from the Environmental Protection Agency's Office of Research and Development found triclosan had thyroid and estrogen effects in animals. The agent is a common ingredient in antibacterial soaps and washes, toothpastes, and cosmetics, all of which are regulated by the FDA. The ingredient's profile was raised in January when Rep. Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.), chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Subcommittee on Energy and Environment, wrote the FDA to ask about a review of triclosan's use in consumer products. Additional investigation was deemed necessary after animal studies showed potential negative effects of the ingredient, the FDA said in a prepared statement. Though studies are ongoing, the FDA does not currently have enough evidence to suggest a change to any consumer products with triclosan. The FDA noted that although triclosan provided a clear benefit in some consumer products, the extra health benefit it offered in others was not as apparent. The agency advised consumers that the ingredient poses no apparent danger to humans, but that soaps and body washes with triclosan may not provide additional health benefits over soaps without the additive; consumers concerned about its potential health hazards should switch to regular soaps without triclosan. The FDA announced it will work with other federal agencies, including the Environmental Protection Agency, to study the effects of triclosan on humans, animals, and the environment. The agency said it planned to publish its findings in spring 2011.

The researchers speculated that these cells might be influenced by the sex hormones estrogen, which has been shown to affect bone metabolism, and testosterone. They analyzed tissue samples from 372 men and women with arthritis who'd had a total knee replacement. Most were in their early 70s. In the joint fluid of the participants, they found 17 beta-estradiol, a form of estrogen, which they said increases calcium deposition in both sexes. And, in the osteoarthritic tissue, they found CPCs positive for estrogen receptors and androgen receptors. The researchers, also found that unique CPCs were present in the cartilage of people with late-stage osteoarthritis (OA). \"We were able to isolate CPCs in 95.48 percent of female patients and 96.97 percent of male patients, making these cells a good target for future therapeutic intervention for a very large number of OA patients,\" Dr. Nicolai Miosge, from August University in Goettingen, said in a news release from Wiley-Blackwell, which publishes Arthritis & Rheumatism. The findings are reported in the journal's April issue. \"Hormone replacement therapy in joint fluid may help mitigate the effects of OA,\" Miosge concluded, adding that further investigation was needed.

In October 2008 I was put on Arimidex. It wasn't long before I began experiencing joint & bone pain. Started off mild and over weeks & months became very difficult to manage. Fatigue had me in bed every afternoon as soon as I got home from work. I missed a lot of days and went home early quite a bit. My emotions were raw and I actually began to understand the \"quality of life\" decision. To sum it all up, my experience with Arimidex was NOT good!! Over time I was advised by several to change to Femara, but I was afraid to make the change. It took me three months to finally give in and that only happened because I was told by four doctors in the same week that it would be okay for me to change. Apparently I had it in my head that Arimidex was given to me first because that's what I was supposed to be on and any variation from that would open the door to recurrence. Crazy, I know, but that's where I was emotionally at the time. Somehow I was convinced that not taking Arimidex would allow a FLUSH of estrogen to come in a feed all of those little hidden cancer cells missed by chemo. In August 08 I gained enough courage (& trust) to stop Arimidex for two weeks and start Femara. Oh my gosh!!! My life has taken a total 180! Occasional joint pain in my hands, but goes away once I start moving. I can stay up until 11 p.m. and haven't missed a day of work since stopping Arimidex.

J.P. Moczulski/The Globe and Mail Doctors split over recommending expensive test to determine benefits of tamoxifen LISA PRIEST From Thursday's Globe and Mail Published on Thursday, Oct. 15, 2009 12:00AM EDT Last updated on Thursday, Oct. 15, 2009 3:28AM EDT Thousands of Canadian breast cancer patients who take tamoxifen for years in the hope of fending off a recurrence may be doing it for naught: Because of their genetic makeup, the drug is doing little or nothing to help them. A test that could tell which patients are less likely to benefit from the drug is not widely available in Canada. The test is being done in the United States, but it is expensive, and requires women to send blood samples or cheek swabs to the U.S. labs that perform it. The test is looking for a variation in the gene that controls the activity of the CYP2D6 enzyme that might make the tamoxifen less effective in combatting cancer. Some women are balking at the $500 cost for the test, while others are forging ahead, even though medical oncologists disagree on whether to recommend it to patients. The Canadian Association of Provincial Cancer Agencies hasn't taken a position because it says the scientific evidence isn't reliable enough. However, its executive director, Heather Logan, said women have a right to information about the test, and patients should discuss it with their clinicians. Ellen Warner, director of Pynk, the breast cancer program for younger women at Toronto's Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre, said her \"gut feeling\" is that all women on tamoxifen should be tested. So far, about a dozen women have sent their blood to the Mayo Clinic for testing. Some physicians are also using Toronto-based pharmacy.ca, which sends patients' cheek swabs to a U.S. teaching hospital, providing results in two weeks. An estimated 22,700 women will be diagnosed with breast cancer in Canada this year. Many of them will be given tamoxifen: 206,490 prescriptions of the generic drug were filled last year, costing $4.8-million, according to IMS Health, a private health-information and consulting-services company. Dianne Theoret-Major, 47, was diagnosed with breast cancer earlier this year, and tested in June for the genetic variation that affects the activity of enzyme CYP2D6. \"I didn't care about the cost,\" said Ms. Theoret-Major, who lives in Halton Hills, northwest of Toronto. \"... I have two kids, aged 13 and 12. It's a real worry to me and I wanted to do everything I could so I was still in their life. I did not want to turn around in six months to find out I should be on another drug.\" As it turned out, she was able to stay on tamoxifen. Her medical oncologist, Sandy Sehdev, believes all women on tamoxifen or who are going to be on it should be tested. \"What would I do for my mom or wife,\" asked Dr. Sehdev, who practices medicine at William Osler Health Centre in Brampton. \"I would only recommend to my patients what I would recommend to my family.\" Typically, patients with estrogen-receptor-positive breast cancer who are premenopausal are prescribed tamoxifen, now a generic drug, for five years. Studies show it reduces cancer recurrence by 50 per cent. The enzyme CYP2D6, known as 2D6, converts tamoxifen into a substance called endoxifen, which is what exerts the cancer-fighting effect. Variations in the gene that controls 2D6 mean that up to 7 per cent of people on tamoxifen have an inactive enzyme. Those 7 per cent are low metabolizers, meaning they produce little or no 2D6 and may not be able adequately to convert tamoxifen to endoxifen. The metabolization levels are also important, some researchers say, when a patient is on antidepressants, which can interfere with tamoxifen's effectiveness. Some oncologists suggest that how a woman feels on tamoxifen can be a sign: if she is having hot flashes, the drug is working. If not, the opposite may be true. \"If you feel good on tamoxifen, the good news is you feel great,\" said Dr. Warner, a medical oncologist. \"The bad news is that it's probably not working.\" Those who are found to be low metabolizers are usually switched to aromatase inhibitors, a class of drugs that are far more costly than tamoxifen. As well, since most patients on tamoxifen are premenopausal, they would also have to take an ovary-suppressing medication. Karen Gelmon, co-chair of the National Cancer Institute of Canada clinical trials group breast site committee, calls studies on the genetic variation intriguing but not definitive, and said the data are \"too shaky\" to make a decision. \"When we have good scientific evidence,\" said Dr. Gelmon, a medical oncologist, in a telephone interview from Vancouver, B.C., \"we will rush to put it into guidelines.\" Likewise, Pamela Goodwin, director of Marvelle Koffler Breast Centre at Mount Sinai hospital and head of the medical oncology breast program at Princess Margaret Hospital, both in Toronto, believes routine testing is premature because she doesn't think there is enough evidence to warrant it, adding that she and others continue to discuss studies' results. \"We would be the first to do something if we thought it was clear that it impacted the outcomes,\" Dr. Goodwin said. \"... It's one of these ones where I don't know if we're going to reach a point whether there will ever be enough evidence. But we're going to stay on top of it.", "Details": "Dx 7/6/2009, IDC, 3cm, Stage IV, Grade 3, mets, ER+/PR+, HER2-"},

Ingle, MD; Michel Eichelbaum, MD; Matthias Schwab, MD; Hiltrud Brauch, DPhil JAMA. 2009;302(13):1429-1436. ABSTRACT Context The growth inhibitory effect of tamoxifen, which is used for the treatment of hormone receptor-positive breast cancer, is mediated by its metabolites, 4-hydroxytamoxifen and endoxifen. The formation of active metabolites is catalyzed by the polymorphic cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6) enzyme. Objective To determine whether CYP2D6 variation is associated with clinical outcomes in women receiving adjuvant tamoxifen. Design, Setting, and Patients Retrospective analysis of German and US cohorts of patients treated with adjuvant tamoxifen for early stage breast cancer. The 1325 patients had diagnoses between 1986 and 2005 of stage I through III breast cancer and were mainly postmenopausal (95.4%). Last follow-up was in December 2008; inclusion criteria were hormone receptor positivity, no metastatic disease at diagnosis, adjuvant tamoxifen therapy, and no chemotherapy. DNA from tumor tissue or blood was genotyped for CYP2D6 variants associated with reduced (*10, *41) or absent (*3, *4, *5) enzyme activity. Women were classified as having an extensive (n=609), heterozygous extensive/intermediate (n=637), or poor (n=79) CYP2D6 metabolism. Main Outcome Measures Time to recurrence, event-free survival, disease-free survival, and overall survival. Results Median follow-up was 6.3 years. At 9 years of follow-up, the recurrence rates were 14.9% for extensive metabolizers, 20.9% for heterozygous extensive/intermediate metabolizers, and 29.0% for poor metabolizers, and all-cause mortality rates were 16.7%, 18.0%, and 22.8%, respectively. Compared with extensive metabolizers, there was a significantly increased risk of recurrence for heterozygous extensive/intermediate metabolizers (time to recurrence adjusted hazard ratio [HR], 1.40; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.04-1.90) and for poor metabolizers (time to recurrence HR, 1.90; 95% CI, 1.10-3.28). Compared with extensive metabolizers, those with decreased CYP2D6 activity (heterozygous extensive/intermediate and poor metabolism) had worse event-free survival (HR, 1.33; 95% CI, 1.06-1.68) and disease-free survival (HR, 1.29; 95% CI, 1.03-1.61), but there was no significant difference in overall survival (HR, 1.15; 95% CI, 0.88-1.51). Conclusion Among women with breast cancer treated with tamoxifen, there was an association between CYP2D6 variation and clinical outcomes, such that the presence of 2 functional CYP2D6 alleles was associated with better clinical outcomes and the presence of nonfunctional or reduced-function alleles with worse outcomes.", "Details": "Dx 8/2007, IDC, 1cm, Stage I, Grade 3, 0/3 nodes, ER+/PR-, HER2+"},

My pre-diagnosis biopsy revealed the small area of invasive cells, but the lumpectomy (clean margins) had no more invasive cells. Nonetheless, my breast surgeon and my medical oncologist recommend Tamoxifen for me because \"most all women with my diagnosis have positive receptors.\" I am glad they are confident, but it bothers me to take a drug for 5 years risking some serious side effects without knowing for sure if the drug is even appropriate for my body.

I had a lumpectomy in July and had an onco test done. My score was 16 with a 10% chance of distance recurrence. ,, thus low risk, not very low but low. I have LVI. present in a one small focus- onco doesnt really take this into acccount. On my first visit to my oncologist he first recommended chemo to me cuz of adjuvantonline and pathology report results. The Onco test wasnt done yet. He spoke to me for an hour about chemo would be beneficial at about 3.5%, My next appointment after the ONco test was done he changed his mind and recommended to only do radiation, tamoxifin, suppression of my ovaries and zolatronic acid. So whats the problem ..huh.. I am scared because I feel like chemo was taken away and in my mind it seemed like my hope reduce my risk of survival or recurance from 10- 7%. . its in my mind i know.. but i spent a month convincing myself to bite the bullet and do chemo and now I gotta switch my thoughts to how chemo isnt good for me...and live with a 10% risk of recurrance. I also got 2 other oncologists opinions and my oncologist read them.... those 2 didnt recommend chemo either because it is of small benefit and because onco test is more sophicated test as its genetically based then adjuvantonline... There is also a feeling I have that he changed his mind because it was easier to agree with the 2 others then to convince me of chemo, which would take too long. I know i asked alot of questions to the oncologist, and he was busy and running 2 hours late, so that is why i think he didnt want to get into it again and i am left confused. So to you women,, I ask Did anyone else go through a ying yang like this.. or have an onco test overrule the adjuvant test.... or do any of you have lvi and didnt do chemo.. oh boy.. i mean oh girl.. hope to hear from u.. i think u are all the best.. .

As with every decision...there are pros and cons. Drugs to prevent breast cancer carry heavy risks September 14, 2009 NEW YORK (Reuters Health) - Tamoxifen and other drugs used to help prevent breast cancer in women at high risk for the disease carry their own potential health risks and should be prescribed with caution, researchers warn in a report published Monday. Breast cancer is the second most common cancer among women, causing 40,000 deaths a year. For women with a close family history of the disease, doctors may prescribe tamoxifen, raloxifene or tibolone to help cut their risk of getting breast cancer. To assess the benefits and harms of these drugs for preventing breast cancer, researchers reviewed eight relevant clinical trials. All three drugs, they report, were effective in reducing the risk of breast cancer. Relative to placebo, tamoxifen, raloxifene, and tibolone reduced the risk by 30 percent, 56 percent, and 68 percent, respectively. This equates to 7 to 10 fewer cases of breast cancer per 1,000 women per year. However, they also found that tamoxifen and raloxifene increase the risk of blood clots, tamoxifen ups the risk of endometrial cancer, and tibolone raises the risk of stroke. Still, the absolute risks of these events are small and, for many women, the pros of taking these agents are likely to outweigh the cons, Dr. Heidi D. Nelson, from Oregon Health and Science University, Portland, and colleagues note in the latest issue of the Annals of Family Medicine. Compared with placebo, tamoxifen and raloxifene increased the odds of blood clots by 93 percent and 60 percent, respectively, which equates to 4 to 7 extra cases per 1,000 women per year. Tamoxifen was also linked to roughly a twofold elevated risk of endometrial cancer, which yields an extra 4 cases of the cancer per 1,000 women per year. Tibolone was found to increase the risk of strokes, particularly in women over 70 years. The researchers suggest that doctors use caution in prescribing these drugs to prevent breast cancer, as more research is needed to determine which patients would benefit the most, while suffering the least amount of harm.

{"Title": "new study of AI pain", "Post-Data": "Posted on: Sep 25, 2009 04:25PM socallisa", "Post": "www.medscape.com From Medscape Medical News Aromatase Inhibitors and Joint Pain: A Deeper Look Nick Mulcahy September 23, 2009 - One third of postmenopausal women with breast cancer taking aromatase inhibitors (AIs) reported arthralgia - either new onset or worsening, according to investigators of a new study published online September 14 in the Journal of Clinical Oncology. This percentage of patients experiencing joint pain was \"expected,\" according to an editorial accompanying the study. However, the study authors did not stop at investigating the prevalence of AI-associated arthralgia. Because \"few studies\" have investigated the morphologic changes in joints and tendons in patients with this pain, the study authors used sonographic and electrophysiologic measurements to take a look at the affected tissues. Nevertheless, the new study does not authoritatively correlate the findings from sonography and electromyography with clinical findings, observes the editorialist, Rowan T. Chlebowski, MD, PhD, from the Los Angeles BioMedical Research Institute at Harbor UCLA Medical Center in Torrance, California. For instance, patients in the study with AI-related arthralgia had more frequent electrophysiologic findings of carpal tunnel syndrome (46% vs 20%; P < .05) than those without arthralgia (including those taking and those not taking AIs). However, this 49% incidence of carpal tunnel syndrome in patients with AI-associated arthralgia is much higher than when the syndrome is identified through clinical symptoms. In large clinical trials of AIs and tamoxifen, the incidence of carpel tunnel syndrome was less than 3% for patients taking the AIs, Dr. Chlebowski notes. The authors of the new study acknowledge that \"the real prevalence of carpel tunnel syndrome would have been different if the signs and symptoms [had] been taken into consideration.\" Very few patients discontinue treatment because of arthralgia. AI-associated arthralgia is a \"substantial problem\" and one in need of \"improved interventions,\" Dr. Chlebowski writes. However, the editorialist and the study authors agree that most joint pain associated with AIs is mild to moderate and is best managed with analgesics. \"Very few patients discontinue treatment because of arthralgia,\" the authors note. More Findings In the study, 120 postmenopausal patients with stage I to III breast cancer were evaluated for anatomic changes in the joints, and inflammatory markers were compared by Turkish investigators, led by Omer Dizdar, MD, from Hacettepe University Institute of Oncology in Ankara. The team found that a range of markers of inflammation, such as C-reactive protein, were comparable in the patients taking AIs and the control subjects, and in the study participants with and without arthralgia. The study supports previous reports that autoimmune disease \"does not play a role in the etiology of AI-associated arthralgias,\" observes Dr. Chlebowski. With regard to anatomic changes, the investigators found that the patients often had changes in their affected joints and tendons. Women taking AIs (n = 92) had increased tendon thicknesses, which is associated with the syndrome, compared with a control group of women (n = 28) with breast cancer not receiving the therapy (P < .01). Patients with AI-related arthralgia had more frequent joint and tendon effusions than those without pain (69% vs 42%; P < .05). \"These findings suggest that increased tendon thicknesses in patients on AIs may reflect some form of tendinopathy secondary to AI use. Further damage to the tendons and synovium results in effusions in tendon sheaths in a subgroup of patients, which is translated as arthralgia clinically,\" the authors write. Anatomical matters aside, both Dr. Chlebowski and the study authors believe that arthralgia in this setting is also related to hormonal factors to some degree. Both note that joint pain is also a problem in postmenopausal women, even without breast cancer. In the landmark Women's Health Initiative (WHI) study, 74% of women without breast cancer reported joint pain, writes Dr. Chlebowski. Notes on Managing Arthralgias This study does not change the basic approach of clinicians to arthralgia, says Dr. Chlebowski. At present, oncologists should carefully observe their patients for development of this problem. \"At present, oncologists should carefully observe their patients for development of this problem, clearly express to their patients the benefits of continued adherence [to AIs], and provide the limited available therapies,\" he writes. The limited therapies can include acupuncture; 1 small pilot study suggested benefit from a 6-week regimen, notes Dr. Chlebowski. Vitamin D supplementation is a question \"considered open,\" he adds, explaining that 2 ongoing studies are evaluating high-dose supplementation for AI-associated joint pain. However, 2 other trials, including the WHI, did not show any benefit from the vitamin, he says. Joint pain associated with AIs still does not have an \"optimal management strategy,\" writes Dr. Chlebowski. Nevertheless, he cites a recent expert panel's recommendation to use \"high-dose nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or selective COX-2 inhibitors as initial short-term therapy . . . to address initial pain relief, with subsequent titration to minimum effective dosage\" (Ann Rheum Dis. 2007; 66:377-388). Dr. Chlebowski reports being a consultant to AstraZeneca, Novartis, and Pfizer, all of which market AIs, and receiving honoraria from AstraZeneca and Novartis. The study authors have disclosed no relevant financial relationships. J Clin Oncol. Published online before print September 14, 2009.

On the 12th of this month, I started having annoying stingy/scratchy irritation in my urethra, the kind one has when they have a UTI except minus the full bladder feeling. I haven't had a UTI for years and thought that given the excellent health I'm in, it seemed rather odd. So I went to my general physician to get checked out. I did a pee test which came up negative with the in-office test and the result was confirmed on the urine culture they went ahead and sent out to the lab. I wondered if the irritation could be a side effect of the Fareston. Last Saturday afternoon and evening, I had the irritation but was fine again on Sunday all the way through to last night when my husband and I had intercourse. There was no discomfort during intercourse but afterwards when I urinated, I experienced a sudden sharp sting when the urine started coming down my urethra. Thereafter, I had continuous annoying and uncomfortable stingy/scratchy irritation along with another one or two painful pees. The annoying irritation has continued through today. My oncologist's PA told me today when I called that it could be a side effect because apparently Fareston can thin a woman's organ tissue making it prone to \"injury.\" She advised me to stop the Fareston today for a period of 2 weeks and see if the symptoms go away.

Then on 6/12, I started having irritation in my urethra like one has when they get a urinary tract infection though I wasn't feeling the urge/pressure to go to the bathroom all the time. I went to my general practitioner for a urine test which came back negative for a UTI. She suggested I call my oncologist and make him aware of my symptoms which I was already planning on doing if my urine test came back negative because I suspected the irritation might be a side effect/caused by the Fareston. I called my onco and he said it was likely the irritation was, in fact, due to the Fareston, but to continue taking the Fareston for another 2 weeks to see if the symptom continued or subsided; if it didn't subside, he said to stop taking the Fareston for 2 weeks until my next appointment with him.

That Thursday night, my husband and I had intercourse, which was fine, but when I went to use the bathroom afterwards, I got a sudden and very sharp sting---enough to make me want to cry---when the urine started coming down my urethra. That happened another time or 2 that evening but subsided by the following morning. However, the urethra irritation was back again. I called my general practitioner again and she said she wouldn't be opposed to me coming back in to do another UTI test and a pelvic exam just to be absolutely sure I didn't have some type of infection. So yesterday, I went for the pee and pelvic exams. Unexpectedly, I had a rather painful pelvic which would have otherwise been pain-free and just a tiny bit uncomfortable. It stung when and after she swabbed me and it hurt a little and felt unusually uncomfortable when she checked my right ovary. She said I had a lot of discharge with \"puss cells\" in it indicating I have some type of infection going on and she said my right ovary felt \"full.\" She also said I had a small amount of Strep in my urine but wasn't terribly concerned about it. She prescribed 2 different antibiotics---one, I think, to wipe out the Strep, and the other to kill the Vaginosis. She also wrote me an order to have an ultrasound done on my ovary (which I can now feel today and it's uncomfortable). She doesn't want me to jump to the conclusion that all of this has been a result of the Fareston but before I went on that crap, I had a clean bill of health! I'd had my annual GYN exam 4/2 and everything was normal. I had my annual physical---bloodwork included---on 6/4 and I was given a clean bill of health. I had zero female issues until I was on the Fareston. I honestly think that's what's causing all this, ovary issue included.

It is the first large study to affirm wider anti-cancer hopes for Zometa and other bone-building drugs called bisphosphonates. Zometa, made by Novartis AG, is used now for cancers that have already spread to the bone. The new study involved 1,800 premenopausal women taking hormone treatments for early-stage breast cancer. Zometa cut by one-third the chances that cancer would recur - in their bones or anywhere else. \"This is an important finding. It may well change practice,\" said Dr. Claudine Isaacs, director of the clinical breast cancer program at Georgetown University's Lombardi Cancer Center. About three-fourths of breast cancers occur in women after menopause. Zometa may help them, too, but it hasn't been tested yet in that age group.", "Details": ""},

Will call dr tomorrow! MAY 30, 2009, 3:50 P.M. ET Some Antidepressants Cut Tamoxifen's Effectiveness - Study By Jennifer Corbett Dooren Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES ORLANDO (Dow Jones)--Women taking the breast-cancer drug tamoxifen along with certain antidepressants had more than double the risk of the cancer returning than those taking only tamoxifen, according to a study scheduled to be presented Saturday. The study, led by researchers at Medco Health Solutions, Inc. (MHS), will be presented at the annual Meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology. Several antidepressants, which are prescribed for depression but also to treat hot flashes that can be caused by tamoxifen, are considered to be so-called CYP2D6 inhibitors. Laboratory studies have suggested such drugs can interfere with the active ingredient in tamoxifen. Some antidepressants such as Paxil, Prozac and Zoloft are considered moderate-to-potent CYP2D6 inhibitors while antidepressants like Celexa, Lexapro and Luvox are considered weaker inhibitors. \"We've known that these CYP2D6 inhibitor drugs block the activation of tamoxifen chemically, but this is the first time there's evidence that these drugs are putting women at a much higher risk for recurrent breast cancer,\" said Robert Epstein, Medco's chief medical officer and one of the study researchers. The study involved about 1,300 women who were newly prescribed tamoxifen to treat breast cancer between 2003 and 2005 and were monitored for at least two years, with the average being 2.7 years. The study compared 353 women taking drugs considered to be strong CYP2D6 inhibitor drugs such as Paxil, Prozac or Zoloft to 945 women taking tamoxifen only. Women taking the CYP2D6 inhibitors and tamoxifen had a breast cancer recurrence rate of 13.9% compared to 7.5% of women taking just tamoxifen. Researchers then did a separate analysis of women on antidepressants and found those taking Paxil, Prozac or Zoloft had a breast cancer recurrence rate of 16%, or more than double the rate of women on tamoxifen only. Women taking antidepressants considered to be low CYP2D6 inhibitors like Celexa, Lexapro and Luvox and tamoxifen had an 8% breast cancer recurrence rate, which researchers said didn't translate into an increased breast cancer recurrence rate. -By Jennifer Corbett Dooren, Dow Jones Newswires; 202-862-9294; jennifer.corbett@dowjones.com I", "Details": "Dx 11/11/2006, ILC, Right, 3cm, Stage IIIC, metastasized to bone, Grade 2, 19/20 nodes, ER+/PR+, HER2- Surgery 11/29/2006 Lymph node removal: Right, Sentinel, Underarm/Axillary; Mastectomy: Right; Prophylactic ovary removal Chemotherapy 1/7/2007 Chemotherapy 1/10/2007 Adriamycin (doxorubicin), Cytoxan (cyclophosphamide), Taxotere (docetaxel) Radiation Therapy 5/30/2007 Breast, Lymph nodes Hormonal Therapy 8/19/2007 Femara (letrozole) Dx 10/5/2018, ILC, Stage IV, metastasized to brain/bone, 20/21 nodes, ER-/PR-, HER2-"},

{"Title": "side effect from Xeloda", "Post-Data": "Posted on: May 27, 2009 12:52AM fire", "Post": "Medical report: Cancer patient loses fingerprints By MARIA CHENG, AP 5 hours ago LONDON - When a cancer patient from Singapore traveled to the United States last year, he discovered an unusual side effect of his medication: missing fingerprints. The 62-year-old man was taking capecitabine, or Xeloda, to treat head and neck cancer. Upon arriving in the U.S., immigration officials asked him for his fingerprints. But the drug had caused so much redness and peeling to his fingers that the patient, identified only as Mr. S., had none. Customs officials held Mr. S. for four hours before deciding he was not a security threat, according to the case published Wednesday in a letter to the Annals of Oncology journal. Capecitabine is a common cancer drug, routinely given to patients with head, neck and kidney cancers as well as lymphomas and leukemias. Doctors said very few patients temporarily lose their fingerprints while on Xeloda, but it does happen. \"Most patients will complain they're having difficulty holding things or sensing things,\" said Dr. Otis Brawley, chief medical officer of the American Cancer Society, who was not linked to the case. \"I've never had a patient running into a problem with police authorities, but this is not an exaggeration. It could actually happen.\" After returning home, Mr. S. asked his oncologist, Dr. Eng-Huat Tan at the National Cancer Centre in Singapore, to write a letter certifying he was on capecitabine. Surprised by Mr. S.'s predicament, Tan recommended in his letter to the journal that patients taking capecitabine carry a similar doctor's note if they are traveling to the United States. Unlike most other countries, American immigration officials take two fingerprints from foreign visitors. Tan said up to 40 percent of patients on the drug develop a side effect known as hand-foot syndrome, which causes redness, peeling, numbness and tingling. Of those patients, only a small percentage actually lose their fingerprints. \"Patients probably would not notice anything until they travel to the U.S. and discover to their horror that their fingerprints are gone,\" Tan said. Mr. S. was Tan's only patient to report such a predicament, but Tan said a handful of other cases were described on cancer blogs. Once patients stop taking the drug and apply ice to their hands, their fingerprints will return in about a month. Brawley guessed that U.S. officials became suspicious because criminals sometimes erase their fingerprints with sandpaper or dip them in acid, which would appear very similar to how Mr. S's fingers looked. But he says there are too many side effects from Xeloda, including a weakened immune system and increased cancer risk, that it would be unlikely anyone would take the drug for less-than-honorable reasons. \"No criminal in his right mind would take this drug to try to get rid of his fingerprints,\" Tan said.", "Details": ""},

{"Title": "Tamox may be as good as AI in extensive metabolizers", "Post-Data": "Posted on: May 19, 2009 01:28PM orange1", "Post": "When clinical studies of AIs were ongoing, CYP2D6 metabolizer status of tamoxifen was not routinely tested. Thus intermediate and poor metabolizers were included in the tamoxifen study arm even though it turns out in retrospect, that they were not likely to benefit as much as extensive metabolizers. This decreased the apparent effectiveness of tamoxifen in the study - making AIs look relatively better. The authors of this study looked at the effect of accounting for intermediate and poor metabolizers and created a model to look at how results might have been, had metabolizer status been taken into account. Results indicate that tamoxifen may be just as good or better at preventing recurrence as an AI, depending on assumptions of the effect of intermediate and poor metabolism on outcome. Warning: this article is pretty technical, but worth sharing with your onc if you are on an AI because it is supposedly better. If your are a poor metabolizer, an AI is likely to be better for you. http://jnci.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/100/9/642 Pharmacogenomic Variation of CYP2D6 and the Choice of Optimal Adjuvant Endocrine Therapy for Postmenopausal Breast Cancer: A Modeling Analysis Rinaa S. Punglia, Harold J. Burstein, Eric P. Winer, Jane C. Weeks Affiliations of authors: Departments of Radiation Oncology (RSP) and Medical Oncology (HJB, EPW, JCW), Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA Correspondence to: Rinaa S. Punglia, MD, MPH, Department of Radiation Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Brigham and Women's Hospital, 44 Binney St, Boston, MA 02115 (e-mail: rpunglia@partners.org ). Background: Adjuvant endocrine treatment with aromatase inhibitors improves disease-free survival compared with tamoxifen in postmenopausal women with estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer. This difference could be due to differences in tamoxifen metabolism because levels of endoxifen, the active tamoxifen metabolite, vary with the number of mutant alleles, including the *4 allele, of the gene encoding cytochrome P450 2D6 ( CYP2D6 ). Methods: We created a Markov model to determine whether tamoxifen or aromatase inhibitor monotherapy maximized 5-year disease-free survival for patients with the wild-type CYP2D6 genotype (wt/wt). Annual risks of recurrence with aromatase inhibitors and tamoxifen in breast cancer patients who were not selected by CYP2D6 genotype were derived from the Breast International Group 1-98 trial. Genotype frequencies and the hazard ratio for cancer recurrence on tamoxifen among patients with the *4/*4 genotype relative to the wt/wt or wt/*4 genotypes (HR *4/*4 = 1.86) were based on data from an analysis of the North Central Cancer Treatment Group trial of adjuvant tamoxifen. We explored the impact of CYP2D6 (*4) heterozygosity on disease-free suvival for wt/wt patients by studying a range of effect (ie, recurrence on tamoxifen) estimates, from no effect of the single mutation (Eff wt/*4 = 0, recurrence rate in wt/*4 patients same as that in wt/wt patients) to complete effect (Eff wt/*4 = 1 recurrence rate in wt/*4 patients same as that in *4/*4 patients). Results: With HR *4/*4 = 1.86 and Eff wt/*4 = 0.5, the 5-year disease-free survival of tamoxifen-treated patients with no mutations (wt/wt) was 83.9%, that is, essentially the same as that (84.0%) for genotypically unselected patients who were treated with aromatase inhibitors. With greater HR *4/*4 estimates, disease-free survival with tamoxifen exceed that with aromatase inhibitors in wt/wt patients, even at lower assumed Eff wt/*4 ratios. Conclusions: Modeling suggests that among patients who are wild type for CYP2D6 , 5-year disease-free survival outcomes are similar to or perhaps even superior with tamoxifen than with aromatase inhibitors. Endocrine therapy tailored to CYP2D6 genotype could be considered for women who are newly diagnosed with breast cancer, particularly those who have with concerns about either the relative toxicity or the increased cost of aromatase inhibitors.", "Details": "Dx 8/2007, IDC, 1cm, Stage I, Grade 3, 0/3 nodes, ER+/PR-, HER2+"},

It is a quick wave of elation that washes over me, often when I first go outside in the morning. It feels like it radiates from my heart.

She was dx last June, mastectomy, chemo and rads. She has gotten through all of the treatments quite well and just started on Arimidex about two weeks ago. She said she feels as though she is a little irritable and has less patience than normal and is wondering if this is from the drug or her imagination. I see from reading here that this might be due to the estrogren being drained from her system. I saw some talk of Vitamin D, Calcium and Magnesium as possible supplements that might make the SEs less severe. Can anyone give me some more info on that? My mom is bummed (as am I) about the thought of not feeling herself for the next 5 years. She wasn't completely sold on the idea of taking it to begin with. I can't understand how they give all women the same dosage? My mom asked about being tested to find out how much estrogen her body is even producing at this point but was told it isn't possible. My mother is 5 feet tall, about 98 pounds and very lean. How is it that she takes the same does as someone who weighs much more? She works out several times a week as well. I just feel like she made it so well through the really bad part of this diease, I hate to see her suffer on this stupid pill. Especially since it is for 5 years. Do the inital symptoms like irritability seem to even out after a while or is that something she may always suffer?

I knew I had fibroids but the sono-hyst showed one that seems to be taking up the whole of the uterus. It wasn't completely clear if it was a polyp or a fibroid so now I have to have the darn thing taken out! In the OR with general anesthesia and everything (I really get creeped out by the idea of a spinal) they do a hysteroscopy and then resect this thing to get it out and make sure it's OK. It's an ordeal but it'll be comforting to have a normal path report (as I'm sure it will be!!!) and to get rid of some of the bulk of my gigantic 11 cm uterus. Maybe my jeans will fit better again! And maybe I won't have pain and constipation so often. So... Anyone had this kind of procedure? I guess it's done to remove polyps and that sounds pretty quick since they just pop it off at the stalk but this doesn't have a narrow stalk. What was the pain and recovery time like? The next day is my day off (what fun) but wondering if I ought to plan ahead to be out the day after that (procedure's in the afternoon). It's such an ordeal to change my schedule.
